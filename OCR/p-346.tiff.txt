counter is reset, for instance, the 256HM signal makes a negative—
going transition that is transformed into a brief negative—going pulse
by the action of lCl-B and ICE-E. This little pulse ﬁxes the horizontal
component of the ball’s image on the screen. ICZ—D and ICES-F
perform the same pulse-generating function, determining the verti—
cal component of the ball ﬁgure from 128VM.

The two components of the ball image are combined at IC3-A,
producing an active-high ball ﬁgure. This ﬁgure goes to several
different gates, including IC6-B where it is combined with the
green-and-hole image to create the game’s composite video-output
signal. That particular EXCLUSIVE-OR gate, incidentally, is also
responsible for switching the color of the ball so that it always
appears with a color that is the complement of its background—
white when on a black background, and black when on a white
background.

The ball ﬁgure also goes to one input of ICZ-A. This gate acts as
a contact sensor that responds whenever the ball touches the hole.
(Recall that the output of IC3-B is the hole ﬁgure.)

The primary purpose of the game control board in Fig. 8-20 is to
control the ball motion once it leaves the initial tee position. When
the ball is in its initial position, it is held motionless by the synchroniz-
ing effects of initializing pulses (HINTP and VIN TP) to the slipping-
counter circuit. Once the player depresses the SWING button,
however, the ball can move and it is no longer under control of the
initialization circuitry until the player makes the hole and depresses
the TEE button. The game-control board handles the ball’s motion
once it is off the initial tee.

The control board does its job by feeding HC and VC speed and
control signals to,the slipping-counter board. The action of these
control signals has been described in detail in Chapter 5. It can be
seen from Fig. 8-20 that a complete set, lHC through 8HC and 1VC
through 8VC, leaves this board.

This circuit is unique among slipping-counter control-word
generators described thus far inasmuch as it can generate any one of
four sets of control words. It can generate a stop code (1001), a
full-speed code, a half—speed code and a special rebound code that
Will be used in a later version of this golf game.

ICs 6, 7, 8, and 9 in Fig. 8-20 are the selector circuits for these
four speed codes. They are actually dual 4:1 multiplexers that select
one of four different input logic levels, according to the status of 2-bit
selector inputs at pins 2 and 14 in each case. a _

The output of ICZ-A goes to E? input of an R—S flip-ﬂop
