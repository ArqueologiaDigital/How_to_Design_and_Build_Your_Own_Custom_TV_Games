moved up and down the screen. The output of the timer in this
instance, however, clears a set of two counters (1C3 and 1C4) and
holds the outputs at zero.

As soon as the timing interval is over, the output of ICZ-A drops
to logic 0, and the two counters are allowed to count in response to
HRST signals from the Sourcebox unit.

The counters continue running through the remainder of the
vertical-scanning interval—until a VRST signal marks the end of a
frame.

The two counter ICs actually generate an alternate set of
V-count pulses. These signals have the same frequency and count—
ing format as the V-count signals from the Sourcebox. But rather
than beginning their count from VRST, these motion-control
V-count signals begin the moment IC2-A completes its timing inter-
val. To distinguish these motion—control V-count signals from their
counterparts from the Sourcebox, the motion-control vertical-count
signals are labeled 1VM, 2VV, 4VM, and so on through 128VM.
(256VM is not included in this format because 256V signals are
rarely used in generating any of the complex ﬁgures described in
Chapter 4.)

1C7, an 8-input NAND gate, is included in Fig. 5-7 only for
experimental purposes. It is normally part of the windowing circuit
for a complex-ﬁgure matrix generator.

E up the circuit in Fig. 5-7a, and connect the output of 1C7 to
the CE connection of a multiplexer. You can then use this motion-
control scheme to position any complex ﬁgure along a vertical line.
See an example in Fig. 5-8.

The circuit in Fig. 58 generates the ﬁgure of a rocket that can
be positioned and moved up and down on the screen by means of the
VERTICAL POSITION control, R1.

Note from the complex-ﬁgure speciﬁcations in Fig. 5—8 that the
matrix generator is seeing its SO input as 4H folded by 8H. Both of
these horizontal-count signals come directly from the Sourcebox.
The vertical—select inputs, however, come from the vertical-motion
control circuit, 4VM, 8VM, and 16VM.

The circuit thus generates a 4x16 extended foldover matrix
that derives its horizontal components directly from the Sourcebox
and its vertical components from the counters in Fig. 5-7a.

Once you get the vertical movable rocket image on the
screen, you can adjust its range of motion by selecting alternate
values of C2 and R2. You will also ﬁnd that changing either or both of
the inverted VM connections to the window section of the circuit
modiﬁes the range of vertical control.
