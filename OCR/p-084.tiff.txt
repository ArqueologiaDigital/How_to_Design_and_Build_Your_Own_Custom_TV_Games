logic level applied to D8 (logic 1) was delivered to the GAME VID IN
connection on the Sourcebox, thus generating a white line. A bit of
white video appeared on the screen each time the horizontal trace
reached a point where it selected the D8 input of the multiplexer.
Moving the logic-0 input around to other D-input positions moved
the active region to different locations on the horizontal traceﬁ

Incidentally, any D input that is not connected anywhere acts as
a logic-1 input. All D inputs that are not connected to COMM (logic
0) thus generate black areas on the screen, and that is why this
experiment shows a single white bar on a black ﬁeld.

Connect more than one D input to logic 0 and note the effect. It
is possible to ﬁll the screen with white bars if all 16 inputs are
connected to COMM.

. It is rather convenient to think of this multiplexer scheme as a
type of memory circuit. The memory is capable of holding 16 bits of
data, and each of the 16 data locations are addressed in sequence by
the signals appearing at the multiplexer’s S inputs.

Bear this in mind while substituting vertical-count inputs for the
horizontal-count inputs at SO, SI, 82, and 83. Be sure to connect the
highest-order V—count input to 83, the next-higher V-count to 82,
and so on down the line to SO. Scrambling the sequence at this point
might cause more confusion than anything else.

THE ADDRESS MATRIX CONCEPT

Since each of the 16 D inputs on the multiplexer represents 1 of
16 different combinations of ls and Os applied to the S inputs, it is
possible to organize those 16 locations into a matrix pattern.

The experiments suggested in the previous section of this
chapter assumed a matrix 1 unit wide and 16 units long. There was
one string of 16 discrete segments across or down the screen,
depending on whether the S inputs were connected to horizontal— or
vertical—count sources.

What do you suppose happens to the D-input addressing if two
of the S inputs, say SO and $1, are connected to H—count inputs,
while the two remaining S inputs, $2 and S3, are connected to
V—count inputs? to be more speciﬁc, try this: connect SO to 16H, 81
to 32H, S2 to 16V, and SB to 32V. Instead of generating a string of 16
segments, you end up with a 4x4 matrix or graph. See Fig. 4-4a.

The H—count pulses determine the horizontal positions on this
little matrix, while the V-count pulses determine the vertical coordi-
nates. Position D10, for instance, is enabled whenever the two
H-count pulses show the decimal equivalent of 2 and the two V-count
signals are at decimal 2. i
