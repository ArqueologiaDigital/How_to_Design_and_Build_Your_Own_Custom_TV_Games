 

condition represents count 261 from the vertical-count source, and it
is responsible for clearing the counters back to zero.

The vertical-count section thus generates 260 different pat-
terns representing that many vertical lines on the screen.

The vertical-blanking and sync pulses are generated in a fashion
almost identical to the corresponding horizontal section. One differ-
ence is that this circuit is built around a ﬂip—ﬂop triggered by
positive-going, rather than negative-going, pulses.

The VBLANK generating ﬂip-ﬂop is composed of NOR gates
IC6-A and IC6—B. The pin-4 output of IC6B is at logic 0 most of the
time, rising to logic 1 only when a VRST (vertical reset) pulse occurs
at the Qoutput of 1C5. This pulse sets the pin-4 output of IC6—B to
logic 1 and, as described earlier in this section, clears the vertical-
count source to zero.

The VBLANK signal remains at this logic-1 level until the 16 V
signal at the input of IC6-B goes to logic 1. This action returns the
pin-4 output of IC6-B to zero and, in fact, forces it to remain at 0 until
another VRST pulse occurs.

The VBLAN K signal thus goes to logic 1 the instant the vertical
counters are reset to zero, and it remains in that condition until the
counters increment to count 16. VBLANK can then be described as
a positive-going pulse that lasts 16 HRST pulses.
