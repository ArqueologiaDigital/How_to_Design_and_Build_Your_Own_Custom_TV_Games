The volume control, speaker, and ampliﬁer arrangement are
shown in more detail in Fig. 2-6. Control R5 should be mounted on
the front panel of the Sourcebox, while the loudspeaker can be
positioned at any convenient place inside the box.

VERTICAL SOURCE AND COMPOSITE VIDEO BOARD

The circuit in Fig. 2-7 shows the complete schematic diagram
for the vertical-count source and composite video generator. The
vertical-count source consists of 1C1, 1C2, 1C3, IC4-A, and 1C5. The
remainder of the circuit is responsible for composite video opera-
tions.

The vertical-count source is a 9-bit binary counter made up of
two 4—bit counters and a toggled J -K ﬂip-ﬂop, 1C3. The natural
counting range for a 9-bit counter is between 0 and 511; but like the
horizontal-count generator, this circuit is ﬁxed so that it counts a
much more limited range. ' _

Note that the two counters, 1C1 and 1C2, are cleared by the Q
output of ICS, while the J -K ﬂip-ﬂop (1C3) is cleared to zero by the Q
output of 1C5. 1C5 is a positive-edge triggered D flip-ﬂop having a Q
output that takes on the logic level of its D input whenever the CLK
input shows a positive-going edge. The ﬂip-ﬂop in this case is
clocked by HRST from the Horizontal Source board-at a frequency
very close to 15,750 Hz.

NAN D gate IC4-A keeps the D input to 1C5 pulled up to logic 1
most of the time, so the repeated HRST pulses at the CLK input
keep the Q output of ICS ﬁxed at logic 1 most of the time. There is a
time, however, when the D input to 1C5 is set to logic 0: when the
1V, 4V and 256V inputs to IC4—A show logic 1 at the same time. This
