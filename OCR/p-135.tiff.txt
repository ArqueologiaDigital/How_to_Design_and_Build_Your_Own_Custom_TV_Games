generating a large X ﬁgure that is, itself, made up of smaller X
ﬁgures. Using the circuit in Fig. 4-35, 1C6 generates the little Xs,
and IC5 determines the big X pattern. The designated pattern
window inputs restrict the pattern to a single large X on the screen.
If you understand how the basic complex-ﬁgure generators
work, you can apply that knowledge to the complex—pattern
generator. Any of the complex-pattern generators described in the
ﬁrst part of this chapter can be used as window generators. It is
possible, if not altogether practical, to create a 256-cell ﬁgure matrix
using the circuit in Fig. 4-26, and then repeat that ﬁgure anywhere
within another 256-cell windowing matrix. The result would be a
full-screen, complex pattern of identical complex ﬁgures.
