is depressed. The button must be released before it is possible to
generate another pulse.

The width of the pulse in this case is determined by the values of
R3 and C2. Using the values shown here, the pulse duration is on the
order. of 10 ms.

The LOCK input makes it possible to lock out the START
button action as long as LOCK is at logic 0. This is a handy feature in
games where it is desirable to prevent a player from initiating a
certain playing cycle until something else takes place.

The fact that the circuit in Fig. 6-2c generates an active-high,
positive-going pulse makes it directly compatible with the ﬂip-ﬂop
circuit in Fig. 6—1b.

Comparing the features of the three circuits in Fig. 6-2, the one
in Fig. 6-2a is the simplest, but it should not be used in instances
where an automatic reset action might take place before the player
has a chance to release the START pushbutton.

The circuit in Fig. 6-2b should be used where there is a possibil-
ity that automatic reset will occur before the START button is
released. It does not have any provision for automatic lockout.

The circuit in Fig. 6—2c has none of the disadvantages of the two
other circuits, plus it features an optional lockout input. (If the
lockout feature isn’t to be used, that terminal should be connected to
+5V.)

When selecting the circuit most appropriate for your game
design, consider the complexity, polarity of the outputs, and re-
quirements of the game.

These three circuits, incidentally, can be used in the same ways
for manually resetting game operations. Simply switch the START
and START labels to STOP and STOP respectively.

Automatic Stop Circuits

Games, or cycles within games, can be stopped or reset au-
tomatically by means of the circuits in Fig. 6-3. These are both
pulse-generating circuits: The active-high STOP pulse from the
circuit in Fig. 6-3b is directly compatible with the ﬂip-ﬂop circuit in
Fig. 6—1b, while the active-low output from the circuit in Fig. 6-3a is
compatible with that in Fig. 6-1a.

In both cases, the stopping action is initiated whenever a given
set of stop conditions are met within the system. ICl-A in Fig. 6-3a,
for example, normally shows a logic-1 output. Whenever all the
inputs to this NAN D gate ﬁnd their way to a logic-1 state (presuma-
bly at the time all the conditions for automatic resetting are met), the
