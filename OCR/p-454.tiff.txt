the screen. In frame 1, his feet are both on the “ground” and his arms
are straight down at his sides. He then takes a step with the left foot
in frame 2, extending his right arm and bending up the left one
slightly. He returns to the basic position once again in frame 3, and
then takes the next step with his right foot in frame 4. Presenting
these four frames in sequence and at a rate of about 2 Hz creates the
illustration of a walking ﬁgure.

Any one of these four ﬁgures can be generated by the 8 x 8
extended matrix circuit shown in Fig. 4-17. The trick is to generate
all four figures without having to build four separate matrix-
generator circuits.

Notice, for instance, that frames 1 and 3 are identical in every
respect. It is thus possible to generate both of these frames from the
same matrix- generator programming. Frame 2 is obviously different
from frames 1 and 3, but it is quite similar to frame 4. Frames 2 and 4,
in fact, are simply mirror images of one another, with the mirror axis
running vertically through the middle of the matrix. The signiﬁcance
of this mirror effect is that frame 4 can be generated from the same
matrix generator for frame 2, but making the horizontal counting
take place in the opposite direction.

To express the differences between frames 2 and 4 in another
fashion, consider the matrix fold-over scheme described in Chapter
4. In that instance, the size of a symmetrical ﬁgure could be doubled
in complexity by simply reversing the direction of the matrix addres-
sing half way through the operation. In this case, the direction of
addressing for horizontal counts is reversed through the entire
frame, frame 4.

The four~frame sequence in Fig. 11-2 can thus be digested
down to two basic ﬁgures, frames 1 and 2. The programming for the
data fed to the matrix generator takes on one particular form when
generating frame 1, then the data is changed to generate the image in
frame 2. The animation sequence returns to the ﬁrst set of data
programming to generate frame 3. And ﬁnally, two things happen at
once to generate frame 4: The data programming is returned to that
of frame 2 and the direction of horizontal counting is reversed.

So the ﬁrst step in building an animated video sequence is to
plan the frames, keeping them as simple and as much alike as
possible. The second step is to analyze the frames, attempting to
take advantage of their similarities and reducing the amount of data
programming required.

Ultimately the four frames in Fig. 11-2 will be called up in
sequence, and since there are four frames, the calling operation
