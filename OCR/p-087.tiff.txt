Fig. 4-5. The basic 16-celi matrix generator circuit.

now ﬁlled with White cells because any unconnected input of a TTL
IC automatically assumes a logic-1 condition.

Connect a single jumper wire to COMM and touch the free end
to various D inputs on the multiplexer. You will ﬁnd that applying a
logic-0 level to the D inputs in this fashion causes the corresponding
matrix cell on the screen to go black. Connect the jumper to D0
through D15 in succession, and you will see a black square moving
through the matrix as you go.

Building Complex Images in the 4x4 Windowed Matrix

Building complex ﬁgures using the circuit in Fig. 4-5 is a matter
of eliminating white cells by connecting their corresponding D inputs
to logic 0. And if you are really putting your heart into the project,
you can have a good hour or so of fun playing with this scheme.
