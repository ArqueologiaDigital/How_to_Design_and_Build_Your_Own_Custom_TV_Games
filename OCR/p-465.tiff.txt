Input D17, for example, uses two? terms that can be derived
by ORing together D8 and D16. IC6-A accomplishes this task, taking
advantage of the fact that inverted data at the input of a NAND gate
yields an OR function. D14 is obtained in a similar fashion, effectively
ORing together D15 and D23. IC7-A and IC4-E work together to OR
D17 and D24 to produce the D26 input.

D5 and D13 could be derived from ORed combinations of other
D inputs, but more for the sake of illustration than anything else, the
circuit in Fig. 11-7 shows them being generated in a different man-
ner. D5 seems to have a close relationship with the B1 frame-select
bit (D5=0 when 8120, and D5=X when B1=1). So it is possible to
generate the D5 signal by gating it off while B1=0 and allowing X to
emerge when B121. This is a simple AND operation performed by
the NOR gate, IC7—7, operating from inverted versions of B1 and X.

D13, on the other hand, shows Xs as long as B1=0, and it
outputs Os as long as B1 = 1. This is, again, a basic AND operation
that can be carried out by IC7-B.

The data inputs to the 8 x 8 extended matrix generator are
thus completely satisﬁed for all eight frames of the animation se—
quence. All that remains to be done is force the H—count select inputs
to run in reverse for frames 5 through 8. This is easily accomplished
by the three EXCLUSIVE OR gates, IC8—A through IC8-C. Select
inputs SO, 81, and S2 run forward as long as B2 is at logic O—through
the ﬁrst four frames. As B2 rises to logic 1 through the last four
frames, the H-count data is inverted by the EXCLUSIVE OR gates,
effectively forcing the count at the select inputs to run in reverse and
creating the mirror images of frames 1 through 4.

The rate of the teeter-totter effect is adjusted by the RATE
ADJUST resistor which, in turn, sets the counting frequency of 1C2,
the frame counter.

Using the H- and V-count speciﬁcations in Fig. 11-7, the
teeter—totter ﬁgure measures 32H X 32V and is located near the
lower right-hand corner of the screen. Of course these speciﬁcations
can be altered to select any desired size and position.

It is not easy to design and build a video animation sequence.
But the possibilities are unlimited. In fact some experimenters have
chosen to make a hobby of ﬁgure animation alone. Animation effects
can add a great deal of interest to TV games, but the designer must
have the experience and patience to do the job in his own way.
Beginners are encouraged to avoid complex animation sequences
until they feel they have the necessary experience and know-how to
take on the job.
