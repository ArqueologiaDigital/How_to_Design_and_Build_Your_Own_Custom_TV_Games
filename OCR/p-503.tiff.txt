The basic D/A converter is made up of a resistor~ladder net—
work. Two of them are shown in Fig. 12—7. The larger circuit in Fig.
12-7a can accept an 8-bit digital word at inputs P0 through P7, while
the simpler one in Fig. 12-7b can be used with 4-bit digital words.

In either case, the voltage appearing at the junction of R3 and
R4 is proportional to the value of the binary number applied to the P
inputs. That voltage level is then used to set the frequency of a
555-type free-running multivibrator. The TONE input to the 555
oscillator is used for gating the sound on and off. When this input is at
logic 1, the tones appear at the AUDIO output connection. Setting
that TONE input to logic 0, however, silences the circuit.

The values of R1, R2, and C1 determine the range of frequen—
cies available from the circuit. The larger these values, the lower the
tones. The P inputs to the ladder network then determine the
frequency within that selected range that will appear at the AUDIO
terminal. While the analog voltage to the CV input of the 555 timer is
proportional to the size of the binary number applied to the P inputs,
it turns out that the selected frequency is inversely proportional to
the binary number. The larger the number, the lower the audio tone.

So if the eight P inputs in Fig. 12-7a are connected to the
outputs of an 8-bit binary counter, the tone sweeps downward when
the counter is counting upward, and the tone sweeps upward when
the counter is counting downward. Figure 12-8 shows a rather
simple circuit for experimenting with the tone generator. The out-
