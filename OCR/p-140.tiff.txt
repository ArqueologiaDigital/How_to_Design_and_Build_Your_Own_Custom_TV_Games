and clock pulses are applied to the CLK input. The counter counts up
or down, depending on the logic level applied at the U/D terminal.
Setting U/ D to logic 0 lets the counter count up, and setting it to logic
1 makes it count down, or backwards.

The counter can be preset to any desired count by applying the
desired binary count at the preset inputs, PA through PD, and
pulling the L input down to logic 0.

. The counting operation can be stopped and held at any desired
count by raising the ENAB input to logic 1. Counting then resumes
from that point as soon as ENAB is returned to O.

The ripple-clock, RC, and maximum/minimum, M/ M, outputs
perform special cascading and output control functions that will be
described in detail when considering the actual circuits that use
them.

 

SIMPLE PLAYER-CONTROLLED MOTION

Let’s get some motion on the screen as quickly and simply as
possible. To do this, tinker together the circuit shown in Fig. 5-2.

This circuit generates a narrow horizontal or vertical bar on the
screen. The horizontal version can be moved vertically anywhere on
the screen by means of the 500 k0. potentiometer control, R1. And
when you build the vertical version, you will ﬁnd you can move that
bar horizontally across the screen.

The heart of this system is a 555 timer. The circuit in Fig. 5-2
calls for using one-half of a 556 dual timer which, in essence,
performs the job of a single 555 device.

The monostable timing is initiated by the HRST or VRST pulse
from the Sourcebox unit, and the actual amount of timing is deter-
mined by R1, R2, and C2. When generating a movable horizontal
bar, trigger the circuit from VRST and ﬁx the values of R2 and C2 to
3.3 k!) and 0.047 uF. To generate a movable vertical bar, initiate the
timer from HRST and ﬁx the values of R2 and C2 at 33 kit and 100
pF. Note that potentiometer R1, the motion control adjustment, is
500 k!) in either case.

So here is what happens: A vertical or horizontal reset pulse
initiates the monostable timing. It sets the pino5 output terminal
from logic 0 to logic 1, where it remains until the timing interval is
over. If the circuit is triggered by HRST, this timing interval takes
place with every horizontal scan line. Triggering the circuit from
VRST causes the timing to take place once each vertical frame.

The NAND gate (IC3—A), inverter, and associated RC compo-
nents make up a pulse-shortening circuit that functions exactly as
