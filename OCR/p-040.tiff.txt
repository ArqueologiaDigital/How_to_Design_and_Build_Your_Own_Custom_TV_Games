None of the ﬁgure-building techniques is really any better than
the others under all possible circumstances. The most appropriate
technique depends on the size, position, general conﬁguration, com-
plexity of the ﬁgure, and the role the ﬁgure is to play in the display.

The selection of a ﬁgure-building technique thus calls for an
intelligent decision on the part of the experimenter, so it is important
to stﬁdy this entire chapter and the one that follows before making a
ﬁrm commitment to the circuit for an original TV-game display.

A prudent student of TV—game technology will breadboard the
circuits as they are encountered in these chapters. Of course it takes
longer to become acquainted with all the circuits this way, but this
doing-whiIe-reading approach makes the learning process much
easier, more effective, and a whole lot more fun. Try building the
speciﬁc examples ﬁrst, then test your understanding by attempting
to create a few static images of your own.

LINES AND BARS DIRECTLY FROM THE COUNT SOURCES

One of the simplest and most straightforward ways to create
simple lines and bars on the screen is by combining the wave—forms
already available from the Sourcebox unit. All of the horizontal-count
outputs quite naturally generate alternate black and white vertical
bars or lines on the screen, while the vertical-count outputs create
horizontal bars.

Figure 3—1 summarizes ﬁve different horizontal— and vertical-
count signals as they appear on the TV screen. To view the ﬁgures
as shown here, simply connect a jumper wire between the desig-
nated horizontal- or vertical-count output and the GAME VID IN
terminal on the Sourcebox unit. This procedure, incidentally, as—
sumes the CVID and MOD terminals on the Sourcebox unit are
jumpered together as described in the previous chapter.

Note that the 256H display shows a vertical black bar that
almost reaches the center of the screen. This is a clear indication
that the 256H signal is at logic 0 through the ﬁrst half of each
horizontal trace. (A logic-O video signal always creates a black area
on the screen, and a logic-1 signal creates a white area).

The ﬁgure for 128H shows twice as many vertical bars as the
256H signal does. The reason is rather easy to understand: the
128H frequency is twice that of the 256H count source. And in a
similar manner, each lower-order H output shows about twice as
many bars as the one preceding it. Outputs 8H, 4H, 2H, and 1H are
not shown here because the lines are too ﬁne and closely spaced to
make a meaningful picture in the book. Look at them on your own TV
screen, however.
