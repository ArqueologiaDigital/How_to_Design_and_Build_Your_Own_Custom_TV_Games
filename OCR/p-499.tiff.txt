The timing interval for ICl—B is ﬁxed by the values of R4 and
C3. In this example, it is set for about 1 second. The circuit is thus
normally silent. But when the triggering event occurs, ICl-B allows
the “deedle-deedle” sounds to be heard for 1 second.

It is possible to achieve a wide variety of audio effects from this
one simple circuit. The “deedle” frequencies can be altered by
applying different pairs of V-count inputs to IC2—C and IC2-B. The
“deedle—deedle” rate can be changed by experimenting with the
values of R2, R3, and C2. And ﬁnally, the duration of the funny
sounds can be modiﬁed by changing the values of R4 and C3.

SOUNDS FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN V-COUNT SOURCES

Some of the most common sounds for video games are built
around noise or static sounds. Gunshots and explosions are both
good examples of this sort of audio feature.

Figure 12-5 is the schematic diagram for a noise generator. The
noise (or static) is generated by the reverse-breakdown of the
