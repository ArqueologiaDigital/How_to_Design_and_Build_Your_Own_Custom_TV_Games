Perhaps it is time to get off the pabulum and on to the meat of
TV—game design. The following section describes a missile-
launching game that incorporates all the control features described
thus far in this chapter. You will ﬁnd that the game action is rather
nice, but the range of controls is somewhat limited. After describing
this basic missile-attack game, we will return to a further discussion
of more-elaborate initialization controls. These more sophisticated
controls will then add an extra touch of interest and excitement to
the basic missile game.

A BASIC MISSILE ATTACK GAME

The missile attack game described here uses two movable
ﬁgures tentatively labeled image A and B. Image B is the attack
missile that moves across the screen horizontally at a ﬁxed speed
and altitude (the altitude and speed will be made programmable later
on.) Image B is the antiballistic missile that is launched vertically by
the player. The object of the game is to hit the attack missile with the
antiballistic missile.

Figure 6-15a is a ﬂow chart for the basic missile attack controls.
The cycle is started as the player launches the antiballistic missile,
image A. Presumably, the attack missile is appearing at the left-hand
side of the screen at the time.

If A = B (if the two images come into contact), the attack
missile is blanked from the screen (BLANK B), and the antiballistic
missile is reset to its initial position near the bottom center of the
screen.

Whether B is hit or not, it continues its horizontal motion across
the screen. Ifit has been hit, it is blanked (invisible). But in any case,
the motion continues until it reaches the right-hand side of the
screen (B = EDGE). As soon as B reaches the edge of the screen,
it is unblanked so that it becomes visible; and since its left-to~right
motion is continuous,it immediately appearsin its attack position at
the left-hand edge of the screen.

That’s what happens if the player launches B so that it strikes
the attack missile. But what happens if the player misses the missile?

If the player misses the attack missile, image B continues to
move upward until it reaches the top of the screen (A = TOP). At
that moment, the position of that missile is initialized (INITIALIZE
A) and ready for the next attack. If missed, the attack missile
remains visible as it moves to the right-hand edge of the screen.

Of course it is easy to begin beating this game every time since
the attack missile ﬂies at a ﬁxed altitude and speed. You can,
