The broad vertical sync and blanking pulse in Fig. 1-1c carries
horizontal~sync pulses along its top. This is a feature that is neces-
sary for maintaining horizontal sync during the relatively long verti-
cal retrace time. Without maintaining horizontal sync during this
time, the picture would tend to be torn out of sync in the upper
left-hand comer of the screen, the place where the beam is located
when it is no longer blanked.

The block diagram in Fig. l-ld shows the portions of a TV
receiver that are especially relevant to TV games. Horizontal- and
vertical-sync pulses are taken from the video ampliﬁer and are used
for synchronizing their respective sawtooth oscillators. Once the
sawtooth waveforms have been ampliﬁed, they are applied to sets of
coils (the yoke) around the neck of the CRT. The magnetic ﬁelds
thus generated are responsible for positioning the electron beam.

The actual video information and blanking signals are applied to
the cathode of the CRT to modulate the brightness of the beam. The
blanking pulses have a polarity that cuts off the beam completely.
Lower voltages create varying degrees of gray and white. Referring
to the composite video waveform in Fig. l-lc, the “black” voltage
levels are near the top, while the “whites” are near the bottom.

The video information, tucked between each horizontal-
blanking pulse, thus creates shades of gray, the lower the voltage
level, the whiter the spot on the screen.

This is hardly a complete description of the TV system, but it
does touch upon those principles relevant to understanding the
operation of TV games. Readers interested in more details about TV
systems should consult a good TV textbook.

THE BASIC VIDEO GAME SYSTEM

The whole point of the video game system is to create images
on the screen that have shapes and motions relevant to a particular
game scheme. These images, however, must be created in the
context of a conventional TV system, and that means generating
horizontal— and vertical-sync/blank pulses as well as game video
information.

It turns out that the game system must be under the control of
its sync pulses at all times, so it is important to have a reliable and
accurate source of such pulses, not only for operating the game, but
also for controlling the beam on the screen of a conventional TV
receiver.

The whole game system is ultimately synchronized by a crystal
oscillator. In this particular case, the oscillator runs at 14 MHz. The
