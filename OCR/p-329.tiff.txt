Once you are satisﬁed you understand the function of the load
and memory scheme, position the bar close to the middle of the
screen, set the UP/DOWN switch to its UP position, and then set
the RUN/STOP switch to RUN. IC8 in Fig. 8-11 is connected as a
free—running multivibrator, and if it is operating properly, you should
see the bar moving to the right across the screen.

The speed of motion depends mainly on the value of R1. If the
multivibrator is running at its lower frequency limit (about 200 Hz)
the bar drifts across the screen rather slowly. If, on the other hand,
R1 is set so that the multivibrator runs in the neighborhood of 2 kHz,
the bar makes a complete cycle across the screen in about 4
seconds.

IC8, itself, is enabled only through the VBLANK interval. Note
the VBLANK connection to pin 4 of IC8. While this multivibrator is
enabled, it produces clocking pulses for the counters in Fig. 8-9,
effectively changing the position information for the bar. The
changes take place in an orderly fashion, giving the impression of
rather smooth and continuous motion across the screen. The faster
the multivibrator runs through the VBLAN K interval, the faster the
bar advances across the screen.

The direction of motion is determined by the UP/ DOWN
switch, a switch that ultimately sets the DIR control input to logic 1
or 0. The bar thus moves to the right across the screen when
UP/DOWN is set to UP, and then the bar moves to the left when
that switch is set to DOWN.

The motion can be stopped, holding the bar at some particular
point on the screen, by setting the RUN/STOP switch to STOP.
The multivibrator continues producing clocking pulses through
every VBLANK interval, but the bar remains motionless on the
screen because the counters are disabled.
