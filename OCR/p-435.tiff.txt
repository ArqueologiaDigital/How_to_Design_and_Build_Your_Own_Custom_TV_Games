Fig. 10-10. Figures. waveforms, and programming for the Pinball “ball in play"
and scoring figures.

In summary, the counter board in Fig. 10-12 keeps track of the
weighted score and increments the ball count. Both counters are
initially cleared to zero by depressing the PLAY pushbutton, the
score counter increments 1, 2, or 4 points whenever the ball in play
makes contact with certain objects in the playing area, and the ball
counter increments each time a new ball is launched. The ball
counter automatically stops the game when the ﬁfth ball is played.
