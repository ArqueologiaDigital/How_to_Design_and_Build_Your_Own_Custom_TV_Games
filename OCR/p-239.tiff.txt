SA and SB, are used for setting the rate of descent, but that
parameter is loaded into the system by depressing the DESCENT
pushbutton.

The attack missile is then launched by depressing the LAUNCH
pushbutton. Once the LAUNCH button is depressed, Player B is
committed to the path he programmed just prior to the launching
operation. All controls are locked out until the attack missile is
blanked and reset to its initial position.

There are a number of different attack velocities, rates of
descent and initial altitudes that direct the attack missile to the
target. Player B’s task is to come up with one of these proper
combinations that avoids the antiballistic missile. Part of Player B's
strategy, however, might be to throw Player A out of position with a
false run, then make a deadly strike the next time around.

The Flashing Image Circuit

The only portion of this game that has not beem considered in
some detail in earlier chapters is the one that causes the images to
ﬂash when they are hit. The attack missile ﬂashes whenever the
antiballistic missile hits it, and the target ﬂashes whenever the attack
missile hits it. In either case, the ﬂashing effect serves as positive
conﬁrmation of a score.

Figure 7 -4 illustrates the basic image-ﬂashing circuit that will be
used in a number of different games throughout this book. The IC in
this case is a 556 dual timer. Section ICl-A is connected as a
monostable multivibrator that is triggered into action by a brief
negative-going signal, FLASH START.

The output of ICl-A can be used for resetting or timing other
game operations, but more importantly, this timing allows a free-
running multivibrator to generate a pulsing output signal. Whenever
this oscillator, ICl-B, is gated off, it delivers a logic-0 level to one
input of 1C2. In the case of a NOR gate, this means the gate is open,
allowing an inverted version of an IMAGE signal to pass through
uninterrupted.

The moment the oscillator is gated on, however, it generates
sequences of 1 and 0 outputs, thereby interrupting the IMAGE
signal at the same rate. The overall effect is that the IMAGE is
ﬂashed on and off at a rate determined by the values of R2, R3, and
C2, and for a period of time determined by the values of R1 and C1.
