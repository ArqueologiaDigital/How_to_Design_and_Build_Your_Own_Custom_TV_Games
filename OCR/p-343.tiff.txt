signals from the Sourcebox unit. Recall that the “C” inputs come
from the program counter on the logic board in Fig. 8-18.

These two comparators are programmed so that the horizontal
positions of the green can be in any one of seven positions on the
right-hand side of the screen. The vertical positions can be any one
of four possible between the top and bottom. That all ﬁgures out to
28 possible positions, but the program counter allows only nine of
them. It is left to the reader to analyze the programming as shown in
Fig. 8-19, and perhaps alter it to suit his own notions of where the
green should appear.

1C8 uses the “C” states from the program counter to position
the ball when it is ﬁrst set on the tee. There are seven possible
positions between the top and bottom of the screen, but only one
horizontal position that is determined by the H-count inputs at
IC5-C.

The initial position information for the ball is transformed into a
brief pulse by sets of pulse generators, and then leaves the board as
slipping-counter initializing pulse BHINTP and BVINTP.

The foregoing discussion summarizes the purpose and applica-
tion of the comparator-type programming circuits. Recall that the
holes are counted by the program counter circuit in Fig. 8-18. The
outputs of that counter, CA through CD, are then used as program
inputs to three comparator circuits. The comparators then deter-
mine the relative positions of the green and the initial position of the
ball. All that remains as far as the circuit in Fig. 8-19 is concerned is
to see how the ﬁgures themselves are formed.

The horizontal component of the green ﬁgure emerges from pin
6 of comparator 1C7, and the vertical component of that same ﬁgure
comes from pin 6 of 1C9. These two outputs are NANDed together
in ICZ—B to form an active-low version of the green ﬁgure.

The outputs of the comparators also go to an input of two
3-input NAND gates, IC5-A and IC5—B. These two gates are re-
sponsible for generating the little black hole that always appears near
the center of the green. IC5—A generates the horizontal component
of the hole, while IC5-B generates the vertical component.

These two hole components are effectively ANDed together in
IC3-B to generate an active-high version of the hole ﬁgure. The
green and hole figures are then combined at IC3-C to produce the
image of a white green with a black hole in the center of it. Of course
the position of this composite green-and-hole ﬁgure is determined by
the programming of comparators 1C7 and 1C9.

The ball ﬁgure is formed by the most-signiﬁcant-bit outputs of
the slipping—counter board. Each time the horizontal-slipping
