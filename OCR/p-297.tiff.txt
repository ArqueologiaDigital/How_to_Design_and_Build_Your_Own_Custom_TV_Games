and output designations carrying an “A” preﬁx denote connections to
Player A’s systems, while those carrying a “B” preﬁx indicate
connections in Player B’s system.

It might be helpful at this point to look ahead a bit to the wiring
block diagram in Fig. 7-27. You can see the two special Dogﬁght
boards, the vector and ﬁgure boards, servicing two complete
tagalong systems.

Now notice that the vector board in Fig. 7 -25 has four of the 2 x
vector multiplier circuits described previously in Fig. 7-23. Each
receives a set of four primary—ﬁguremotion-control ’bits from the
tagalong control boards.

The ﬁrst of these four 2 X vector circuits accepts bits AIPHC
through A8PHC. These are Player A’s primary ﬁgure horizontal-.
motion codes. The outputs from this same circuit, designated
AlPHC’ through A8PHC’, are the 2x-corrected motion codes for
Player A’s secondary ﬁgure horizontal-slipping counter.

The vector circuit having inputs AIPVC through A8PVC gets
its data from Player A’s primary ﬁgure Vertical-motion control cir-
cuit; and the outputs (AlPVC’ through ASPVC’) go to his secondary
ﬁgure vertical-control circuit.

The two remaining vector circuits in Fig. 7-25 perform exactly
the same operation on Player B’s motion-control codes.

IC8-A in Fig. 7-25 is a timer that is programmed for monostable
operation. Whenever Player A despresses his FIRE button, a
negative-going pulse at ATRIG initiates a l-second output pulse
from ICS-A. This output, labeled AF IRE, is responsible for separat—
ing Player A’s missile from his aircraft. As noted in Fig. 7-27, AF IRE
is connected to the FIRE input on Player A’s tagalong control board.

The timing operation continues until the monostable completes
its normal 1—second interval or a negative-going AMRST pulse
occurs at pin 4. As described in connection with the circuit in Fig.
7-26, this AMRST pulse occurs whenever Player A successfully
shoots down his opponent.

Player B’s ﬁring circuit, built around IC8-B, works the same
way. BTRIG is taken from Player B’s control panel FIRE button, the
BFIRE output separates his missile from aircraft B, and the timer
can be reset immediately by a negative-going pulse at BMRST.

The compact pulse generator made up of IC7-E, IC9-A, and
IC7-F merely generates the 128P pulse required for any tagalong
motion control system. In this case, the 128P pulse services the
tagalong systems for both players.

Since this Dogﬁght game runs continuously, there is no need for
any sort of game resetting operations, and as a result, it is possible to
