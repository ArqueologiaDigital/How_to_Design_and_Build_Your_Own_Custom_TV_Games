The waveforms shown in Fig. 10-8a and the matrix-
programming parameters in Fig. 10—8c are vital to this ﬁgure-
generating scheme. The truly unique feature, however, is the
technique used for making the top and bottom edges, ﬁxed barriers,
and paddle ﬁgures appear as lines instead of the usual matrix squares
and rectangles. This will be explained in connection with the actual
ﬁgure-generating circuit in Fig. 10-9.

Note from the image and waveforms in Fig. 10-8a that a white
line appears only where 16V makes a transition from 1 to 0. A line
does not appear each time this sort of transition occurs, but it occurs
only when 16V shows a 1-to-0 change.

The horizontal TE line, for instance, begins as 16V goes from 1
to O. This line, like all the others, is 4V wide; so its positioning
\_Ie_r_tica1 size are fixed by the vertical-count speciﬁcations, 128V,
64V, 32V, 16V, W, and EV. The horizontal length of the TE line, and
indeed the ﬁeld of play, is one complete 128H cycle long, centered on
the screen where 256H changes from black to white. Setting this
length is a simple matter of doing an EXCLUSIVE OR operation on
256H and 128H.

The horizontal BE line is generated in a similar fashion. It is
situated vertically where 16V makes a 1-to—_Q__transition. But in this
case, the higher-order V-counts are 128V, 64V, and EV, putting it
near the bottom of the screen. Its horizontal Width is also set by an
EXCLUSIVE OR operation on 256H and 128H.

Fixed barrier A occurs where ﬂgoes from 1_£o__0 while the
higher-order vertical counts are at 128V, 64V, and 32V. Barrier B
has the same vertical speciﬁcations, but _t_h_e two are separﬁeﬂ
horizontally by having A occur at 128H and 64H, and B occur at 128H
and 64H. Barrier B is actually nothing more than a mirror image of A.
In fact the right-hand halves of TE and BE are mirror images of their
left-hand halves.

A similar kind of analysis can be apﬂied to any of the lines On the
screen. They all occur at EVAW, and 4V (4V pulses high when 16V
shows a transition) and are separated vertically by various combina—
tions of higher order V-counts 128V, 64V, and 32V.

All of this information is summarized in the D-programming
speciﬁcations in Fig. 10-8c. This data sets the positions of all the
ﬁgures in the playing area, using an 8 x 8 extended foldover format.
The ﬁgures are narrowed vertically to 4V at the output of the matrix
generator, 1C7 in Fig. 10-9.

The 16: 1 data multiplexer in Fig. 10-9 uses the D-input speciﬁ-
cations derived from the ﬁgure and wamms in Fig. 10—8a. As
indicated by the presence of 128V and 128V in the data program-
