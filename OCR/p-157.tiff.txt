The HORIZONTAL POSITION control, R1, should be
mounted to a small project box and wired to the main circuit at pins 5
and 6. If touching this little box causes distortion of the displayed
ﬁgure, run an additional wire from the box, itself, to circuit COMM.

The ﬁgure can be viewed alone by connecting the inverted
output of the multiplexer to card pin 16 (GAME VID IN). When this
circuit is used as part of a larger game format, however, you will take
the output from pin 15.

After mastering the technique for building circuits that allow
vertical or horizontal motion of any complex ﬁgure, you should be
able to generalize the procedure to build circuits having both verti-
cally and horizontally controlled motion of any complex ﬁgure.

To achieve manual control over both vertical and horizontal
positioning, simply build the two circuits in Figs. 5-7 a and 5-9a, using
their VM and HM outputs for the V- and H—count speciﬁcations. Any
ﬁgure generated by the procedures outline in Chapter 4 can be
moved in this fashion.

It is important to experiment with this motion-control scheme
until you grasp some of its more subtle features and master them.
Proper windowing and range of horizontal and vertical motion can
cause some headaches for anyone who has not done their homework
with this system.

The player-controlled motion circuits presented thus far in this
chapter merely represent the simplest and most straight-forward
approaches. There is yet another procedure for achieving player-
controlled motion that will be described in the last sections of this
chapter. The circuits you have worked with to this point are quite
suitable for simpler games that reqire a low budget and not—too-close
control over the ﬁgure being moved.

The motion-control scheme later has the disadvantages of
higher cost and greater circuit complexity, but it has the distinct
advantages of precision control and versatility, versatility in the
sense that it can be used for both player-controlled and automatic
motion. And what’s more, the circuit yet to be described is most
suitable for controlling motion from a stored program.

It is thus a good idea to study this entire chapter before deciding
which kind of player-controlled motion circuit is most suitable for a
particular custom TV game. A bit more time invested in study and
experimentation will pay off in the long run.

AUTOMATIC FIGURE MOTION

A TV game without automatic motion isn’t really a very good
TV game at all. In fact it is automatic motion that separates tradi-
