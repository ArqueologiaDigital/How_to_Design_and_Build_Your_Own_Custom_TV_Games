Where this is the case, the universal programmer comes to the
rescue.

The circuit in Fig. 8-14 shows a practical motion-control circuit
built around a pair of universal-position programmers. Two of the
circuits in Fig. 8-9 are required in this case, one for controlling
vertical motion and another for controlling the horizontal component
of ﬁgure motion.

Both motion circuits are clocked from their own multivibrators:
ICl-A for generating vertical-speed pulses and ICl-B for generating
MCLK pulses for the horizontal-position programmer. The two
position programmers share a common position-initializing circuit
built around IC2-A and ICZ-B. The idea here is to load some pre-
scribed position codes into the position programmers whenever a
negative-going pulse occurs at the INT input, pin 1 of IC2-A. All
counting action stops as long as the system remains in this initializing
mode, and the position programmers take their positioning informa-
tion directly from their respective PD inputs.

A negtive-going pulse at the system’s MOVE input, however,
sets the PL inputs Of the two programmers to logic 1, thereby
