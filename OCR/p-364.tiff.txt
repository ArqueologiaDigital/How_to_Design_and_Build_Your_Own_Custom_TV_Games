killed stormtroopers from the S KILL memory. The S MOTION
control block is responsible for generating the downward motion of
the stormtroopers, while the SH LOGIC block generates the hori-
zontal component of those figures. Assuming none of the
stormtroopers have been shot yet, S KILL memory allows all eight
ﬁgures to appear on the screen. Outputs from the S MOTION
CONTROL AND S KILL memory are combined in the S FIG logic
block to generate the complete set of stormtrooper ﬁgures.

The good guy’s position at the bottom of the screen is ﬁxed by
V-count inputs and G POSITION logic. Motion back and forth across
the screen is controlled by the MOTION control on the panel and the
G MOTION control circuit. The complete good— guy ﬁgure is formed
by the G FIG LOGIC block.

Now suppose the good guy is lining up for his ﬁrst shot at one of
the stormtroopers. The player depresses the FIRE button, and the
G FIRES block generates a 0.5-second signal that is transformed
into the image of a narrow beam by G BEAM logic. This logic circuit
makes the beam appear to come from the good-guy ﬁgure and
extend to the advancing front of the stormtroopers. If the good guy
is lined up properly with one of the stormtroopers during that
0.5—second interval, the SH=GH block senses that fact and the HIT
block generates a scoring pulse for the good guy.

A pulse from the HIT block both blanks the stormtrooper
ﬁgures at S HIDE (they all seem to take cover when the good guy
ﬁres, and eliminates the ﬁgure of the stricken enemy from S KILL
MEMORY. The stormtrooper images reappear with the dead one
missing. '

The trickiest part of the game is that the stormtroopers shoot
back at the good guy. Whenever the good guy crosses the path of
any one of the live stormtroopers (sensed by SH=GH), they pause
for 0.1 second before they all ﬁre a beam at the good guy. The TIME
DELAY block inserts this brief delay before initiating the S FIRE
interval. S BEAM LOGIC generates the stormtroopers’ beam
image that appears to come from each of the live stormtroopers and
toward the good guy’s position on the screen.

GHIT logic senses a contact between any one of the
stormtrooper’s beam and the good guy. This spells disaster for the
good guy because a signal from GHIT automatically stops the game,
resetting the position of any remaining stormtroopers to the top of
the screen.

If the good guy is successful in his attempt to kill off all eight of
the stormtroopers, the ALL S DEAD block senses the condition and
ends the game.
