Alter the phasing so that the slipping counter reaches a count of
100 while the corresponding Sourcebox counter is at 50, and you will
ﬁnd the image shifted 50 scan lines higher on the screen. The
slipping counter in this case is running 50 HRST pulses ahead of the
Sourcebox vertical-count generator.

An image created by the VM outputs of the vertical slipping
counter will be motionless on the screen as long as the frequency is
identical to that of the vertical-count generator in the Sourcebox, but
let the frequencies be different, and you will ﬁnd the image moving
up or down the screen.

Suppose the slipping counter has some provision for altering
the number of HRST pulses it includes in one vertical frame. If this
counter has a counting capacity of 262 instead of the usual 261, it
resets one scan line later per frame. The overall effect is that any
image created from the slipping—counter outputs moves down the
screen at a slow but steady rate.

There are two ways to consider this kind of motion effect. Both
lead to the same conclusion, an it is left to the reader to use the point
of view that suits his own way of thinking.

One way to explain the steady downward motion just described
is to consider that the slipping counter is running one HRST pulse
farther out of phase each time one vertical frame is completed. And
since the position of the image is determined by phase relationship
between the slipping counter and Sourcebox, a continuous change in
that phase relationship produces the effect of a steady motion.

Another way to look at the situation is to consider that the
slipping counter runs at a slightly different frequency than its coun-
terpart in the Sourcebox. If the slipping counter is cycling at 262
pulses per frame instead of 261, that means it is running at a slightly
lower frequency. The slipping counter, in other Words, is running
out of sync with the Sourcebox counter. And since it is running at a
slightly lower frequency, the image “rolls” downward on the screen.

Setting the slipping counter to count out 260 HRST pulses,
instead of the 261 pulse-interval from the Sourcebox, the image will
appear to move upward on the screen. The idea here is that the
slipping counter is running at a higher frequency.

The direction of motion is thus determined by whether the
slipping counter is cycling at a higher or lower frequency than the
corresponding counter in the Sourcebox. If the slipping counter is
running at a higher frequency (short counting) the image moves
upward, and if the slipping counter is running at a lower frequency
(long counting) the image moved downward . Of course the image is
motionless as long as the two frequencies are the same.
