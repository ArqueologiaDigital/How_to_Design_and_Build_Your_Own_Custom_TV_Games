ates AHOR and AVERT control information continuously.vThese
lines are simply the potentiometer connections on Player A’s control
panel.

The A TAGALONG system transforms the AHOR and AVERT
signals into motion~control codes for the slipping counters included
in that system. The primary-ﬁgure motion codes are taken directly
from the input data, while the secondary-ﬁgure codes are modiﬁed
by the 2x vector logic block.

Whenever Player A depresses his FIRE button, ATRIG in-
itiates a monostable timer circuit, AM TIMER. This timer im-
mediately releases the secondary ﬁgure from its host, causing the
missile to leave the aircraft ﬁgure. The blocks labeled ACFIG
LOGIC and AMFIG LOGIC generate the ﬁgures for Player A’s
aircraft and missile respectively.

The operation of Player B’s system is identical to this point,
with the video information for his aircraft and missile coming from
BCFIG LOGIC and BMFIG LOGIC.

The AM=BC logic block senses contact between Player A’s
missile and Player B’s craft. Whenever such a contact occurs, it
indicates a score for Player A. The output of AM=BC both resets
the AM TIMER (returning the A missile to AC) and causing the BC
ﬁgure to ﬂash on the screen.

The same sort of operations are involved in the BM=AC
scheme. Whenever Player B’s missile strikes Player A’s craft, the
BM=AC LOGIC block generates a pulse that both resets the posi-
tion of Player B’s missile and makes Player A’s aircraft ﬁgure ﬂash on
and off.

All four game ﬁgures, the two aircraft and two missiles, are
combined into the ﬁnal GAME VID in the GAME VID LOGIC block.

Dogfight Schematics

Figures 7-25 and 7—26 show the two special control circuit
boards required for this Dogﬁght game. Most of the circuitry in Fig.
7-25 is dedicated to performing the 2 x vector multiplying operations
for both players. This particular circuit board also contains the ﬁring
logic for both players and the 128P generator for the tagalong
systems.

The circuit in Fig. 7—26 contains all the ﬁgure—generating logic
as well as the contact and ﬁgure—ﬂashing logic.

Before explaining the theory of operation of these two boards,
it is important to realize they are used with two identical sets of
tagalong systems, one system for each of the two players. All input
