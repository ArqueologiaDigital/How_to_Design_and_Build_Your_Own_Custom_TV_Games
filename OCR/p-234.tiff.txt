This chapter strikes at the very heart of TV games, de-
monstrating the essential control features without confusing the
issue with a lot of added features (intended by others to make you
buy the product or to keep on shoving quarters in the slot). You can
add the razzle-dazzle later on it you want.

MISSILE ATTACK ll

Here is an extended version of the Missile Attack game already
described in Chapter 6. This version requires two players, one for
controlling the attack missile and another for controlling the antibal-
listic missile. Player B’s task is to program the path of the attack
missile, then launch it toward a target. The attack missile is always
launched from the left-hand side of the screen and at an initial altitude
programmed by Player B. The target is located at the lower right-
hand corner of the screen, and Player B can strike that target using a
wide variety of programmable velocities, initial altitudes, and rates
of descent.

Player A’s task is to protect the target by launching antiballistic
missiles. The antiballistic missile can be launched only from the
bottom of the screen, but Player A can program the horizontal
position of his missile just prior to launching it.

Neither player has any control over their respective missiles
once they are launched.

This game features a pair of program panels that add special
interest to the whole affair. The players get the impression they are
working with a computerized system in a fashion that is not found on
any commercial TV games. This is not an easy game to play. It is a
challenging game bound to spark the interest of players who like to
think clearly, act quickly, push buttons, and throw switches.

The Basic Game Plan

The flow chart in Fig. 7-1 outlines the automatic control scheme
for Missile Attack II. Under normal conditions, Player B launches
the attack missile ﬁrst, presumably setting it on its path toward the
target. Player A then responds by launching the antiballistic missile.

Assuming both missiles are launched and set, the system en-
ters a 4-point-decision—making mode. Suppose the antiballistic mis-
sile strikes the attack missile before anything else happens. (This
would be a score for Player A.) Whenever A = B, the image of the
attack missile ﬂashes on the screen for about one-half second before
it is reset to its initial position again. The antiballistic missile is
immediately reset the moment A = B.
