rather simple circuit for achieving potentiometer control over slip-
ping counters. But in instances where a player is to have manual
control over vertical speed and direction, the control circuit in Fig.
5-12 is the better choice, assuming, of course, the image is a simple
line, bar, or rectangle.

The digital speed and direction control feature of the slipping-
counter circuit, on the other hand, is the better choice in games
calling for automatic or machine control of vertical speed and direc-
tion. The slipping-counter technique is also the only option open
when the ﬁgure is more complex than a simple line, bar, or rectang-
1e.

Master the fundamentals of both vertical-control circuits and
you will be fully prepared to handle any game-designing situation
calling for vertical motion.

SIipping-Counter-Horizontal-Motion Control

While the experimenter might have several options when it
comes to selecting vertical—motion-control circuits, no such options
exist for controlling the speed and direction of horizontal motion.

One might think the vertical—motion circuits described in this
chapter could be modiﬁed to suit the needs for horizontal motion.
The idea might be to simply substitute HCLK for HRST and
HBLAN K for VBLAN K. This is not the case at all. Merely substitut-
ing H-count parameters for V—count parameters creates an image on
the screen that is, ﬁrst, quite confusing and, second, practically
useless.

The primary feature of horizontal counting is that the slipping
counter must not be permitted to change its count length with every
horizontal line. The horizontal-slipping counter must be loaded with
its stop code for every visible scan line on the screen. If this is not
done, the experimenter sees a series of diagonal lines, rather than
straight vertical lines, moving across the screen.

The horizontal-slipping counter must see its stop code at all
times except during one particular scan line, preferably one that
occurs during vertical blanking.

If the horizontal—slipping counter is then loaded with a number
that retards the horizontal timing, the vertical line will appear to
move to the right. That retarded count, however, must occur only
once during the scanning ﬁeld.

0n the other hand, shortening the count during one particular
scan line makes the vertical line appear to move to the left. Again,
the counter must see its stop code at any other time.
