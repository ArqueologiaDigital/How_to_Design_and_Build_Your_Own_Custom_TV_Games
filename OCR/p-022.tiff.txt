signiﬁcant bit. The circuit also generates a vertical-reset
pulse (VRST) that is used for clocking the vertical sync and
blanking generator as well as some of the game circuits.

6. Vertical sync and blanking generator—This circuit gener-
ates vertical sync and blanking pulses. The vertical-sync
pulse ultimately initiates vertical retrace of the TV’s elec-
tron beam. The vertical-blanking pulse (VBLAN K) is used
for blanking the beam through vertical retrace and operat-
ing some of the game circuits.

7. Sync mixer—The sync mixer circuit combines the horizon-
tal and vertical sync and blanking pulses to create a compo-
site sync signal. This signal is practically identical to the
sync signals from commercial TV stations. There is one
important exception, however; this system does not have
provisions for interlaced scanning. Few video games call
for the higher degree of image resolution that charac-
terizes commercial interlaced scanning.

8. Video mixer-The video mixer combines the sync and
blanking pulses with game video information to provide a
complete, composite video signal.

9. RF modulator—The rf modulator is responsible for
amplitude modulating the composite Video signal with an rf
frequency tuned to TV channels 2, 3, or 4. This part of the
Sourcebox unit makes it possible to connect the game
system to the VHF antenna terminals of any standard TV
receiver.

NOTE: FCC REGULATIONS PROHIBIT CONNECT-
ING THE OUTPUT OF ANY RF MODULATOR TO THE
TERMINALS OF AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA. The an-
tenna must be disconnected before the modulator is ﬁxed
to the TV receiver.

10. Audio ampliﬁer—The audio for TV games is not carried via
the composite TV signal through the receiver’s own audio
system. Any audio special effects for a TV game are gener—
ated by the game system and merely ampliﬁed and repro-
duced by a small loudspeaker in the Sourcebox unit.

POWER SUPPLY

The power supply, illustrated in Fig. 2—2, services both the
Sourcebox unit and external game circuits. This is a conventional IC
power supply, taking its main power from the utility lines and
