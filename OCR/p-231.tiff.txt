ﬁgure thus departs from its home, moving away in a direction and at a
speed determined by the VC and HC inputs to the secondary ﬁgure
slipping counter.

Returning SINTC to logic 0 returns the secondary ﬁgure to its
“home” at the primary ﬁgure, whether the primary ﬁgure has been
initialized or not.

The speed and direction of the secondary ﬁgure can be totally
independent of the speed and direction of the primary ﬁgure. The
relationships between the speed and direction of the two ﬁgures are
strictly determined by the HC and VC inputs of the two pairs of
slipping counters. In some instances, however, you might want the
secondary ﬁgure to depart at a faster speed, but in the same direc-
tion as the primary ﬁgure. In this case, connect together the 8VC
and 8HC inputs to the two slipping counters. This will lock together
their directions of travel. The settings of their three lower-order VC
and HC inputs then determine the relative speeds after the secon—
dary ﬁgure is launched.

The Torpedo Attack and Dogﬁght games in Chapter 7 illustrate
the application of tagalong circuits.
