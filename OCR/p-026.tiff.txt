not because the audio signal is part of the horizontal system, but
because there is little space for putting it anywhere else in the
Sourcebox unit.

The entire circuit can be mounted on a standard 44-pin, 4- by
4-inch card, such as a Radio Shack 276-153. In fact all of the circuits
and systems described in this book can be built onto such a board and
then plugged into the appropriate edge-card connector (Radio Shack
276—1551). The numbers in parentheses in Fig. 2—4 indicate card pin
numbers arbitrarily assigned to the card-and-connector assembly.

The heart of the horizontal system, and indeed the video game
as a whole, is the 14—MHz oscillator circuit. This little circuit is made
up of a crystal cut to about 14 MHz and TTL digital inverters 1C7 -A
and IC7-B. Actually the crystal should have a frequency rating as
close as possible to 14.3 MHz, although the system will allow values
within 2% of 14.3 MHz. James Electronics supplies an ideal crystal
for the job (14.31818 MHz). Order part number CY14A, James
Electronics, 1021 Howard Ave., San Carlos, CA 94070.

Although the oscillator is basically a digital circuit, the
waveforms from IC7-A and IC7—C appear sinusoidal on an oscillos—
cope. The toggled J-K ﬂip-ﬂop, ICl-A, isolates the oscillator from
the rest of the circuitry and divides the 14. 3-MHz frequency by two.
The output of ICl—A is thus a quasi-sinusoidal waveform having a
frequency close to 7.015 MHZ. This is the system's HCLK signal.

1C2, 1C3, and ICl-B make up the 9-bit horizontal-count source.
1C2 and 1C3 are ordinary 4-bit binary up counters connected so that
they generate an 8-bit binary count. IC1-B is a toggled J-K ﬂip-ﬂop
that generates the 9th bit. Note that the outputs of these counters
are labeled 1H through 256H, the labels used so frequently through-
out this book.

The nine horizontal—count sources are connected directly to
output terminals, but there is a selection of ﬁve of them that also go
to the inputs of 1C4, an 8—input NAND gate. This is all part of a circuit
that restricts the counting range of the horizontal—count source to
455 HCLK pulses. A 9-bit counter without this resetting circuit
would count 511 states.

The resetting circuitry senses a count of 454 at IC4, generating
a negative-going pulse at the D input of ICSA. IC5A is an edge-
triggered D ﬂip-ﬂop which sets its Q output to the D-input logic level
whenever its CLK input shows a positive-going edge. ICS-A is
clocked by HCLK in this case; and as long as the horizontal—count
source is generating numbers less than 454, the Q output of_IC5-A
remains at a logic-1 level. The complemented output from Q is at
logic 0 at the same time.
