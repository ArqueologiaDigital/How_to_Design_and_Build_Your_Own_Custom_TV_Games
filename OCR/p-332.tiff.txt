switching the circuits from their loading mode to their counting
mode. The ﬁgure is thus free to move on the screen at speeds
determined by the settings of R1 and R4.

The direction of horizontal motion is set by the logic level at the
H DIRECTION input: .1: left and 0=right. By the same token,
the direction of vertical motion is set by the V DIRECTION input:
1: up and 0 =down.

The ﬁgure can be stopped at any point on the screen by setting
the STOP input to logic 1. This action merely stops the motion. It
does not initialize the position of the ﬁgure. Setting the STOP input
to logic 1 is tantamount to entering the stop code (1001, or decimal 9)
into a slipping-counter motion-control circuit.

As shown in Fig. 8-14, the motion-control circuit is a hybrid
analog and digital system. The speed of motion is determined by the
setting of two potentiometers, a feature that is quite convenient for
many game applications. The direction, stopping, and initializing
controls, however, are purely digital in nature. This, too, is a nice
feature in most instances.

As demonstrated in earlier chapters, however, it is frequently
necessary to control the speed of a ﬁgure from some internal cir-
cuitry. Automatic speed control of this sort ought to be digital in
nature. The circuit should be able to accept a binary word that
determines the ﬁgure speed.

Compare this situation with the speed-control scheme for a
slipping counter. In the case of a slipping counter, the most natural
way to control the speed of the ﬁgure is by entering a 4-bit binary
word. The circuit is basically a digital one. Converting the slipping-
counter motion-control system to one having potentiometer control
is a tricky process calling for an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter
circuit.

The situation is just reversed for the universal position pro—
grammer. This circuit most naturally accepts potentiometer speed
controls. And Where it is necessary to control the speed in a digital
fashion, it is necessary to add a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter.
The circuit in Fig. 8-15 shows a simple D/ A converter scheme that is
most appropriate for setting the motion speed.

The D/A converter in this case is a binary ladder network
composed of resistors R7 through R12. The PC inputs are eight
possible combinations of Is and Os, as shown in the table accompany-
ing the circuit. ICl-A is the same multivibrator having that designa-
tion in Fig. 8—14. Two such circuits are thus required for full vertical-
and horizontal-motion control.
