the antiballistic missile system as well as a scheme for setting the
vertical and horizontal speeds.

Suppose the attack missile has been reset to the left-hand edge
of the screen. The R- S flip-ﬂop is then in a condition that (1) allows
Player B to set the horizontal velocity and vertical rate of descent
and (2) ﬁxes the initialization control so that the horizontal— and
vertical-slipping counters are synchronized with the Sourcebox
counts.

The velocity and rate of descent parameters actually control the
1VC, 2VC, 1HC, and 2HC controls of the slipping-counter board
(see Fig. 5-15). The other speed/ direction controls for this counter
are internally wired to assure right—to-left and top—to-bottom motion
of the attack missile. Player B, in other words, can control only the
rates of motion, and not the directions.

The initial position of the attack missile is ﬁxed in the horizontal
position by the signal from the horizontal-initial—logic block. The
vertical position is determined by the setting of control switches SC,
SD, and SE, assembled by the initial-altitude-logic block.

Once Player B depresses his LAUNCH pushbutton, a brief
negative-going pulse at BLAUNCH switches the condition of the
R—S flip-flop, thereby locking out any further control of the missile
and switching the synchronization of the slipping-counter board for
automatic motion across the screen.

The attack missile remains in motion until a brief positive—going
pulse occurs at the BRST input of the R- S flip—ﬂop. At that moment,
the entire system is returned to its reset state.

Whether the attack missile is launched or in its reset state, its
Image is generated by the “B” ﬁgure logic block. The horizontal— and
vertical-counting data for this ﬁgure are taken directly from the HM
and VM outputs of the slipping-counter board.

The block diagram in Fig. 7-5c represents the main game-
control system. The top-logic, edge-logic, and target-logic blocks
simply generate information regarding the positions of those ob-
jects. The target-logic data, however, is the only one of these three
that is actually displayed on the screen.

Note that an inverted version of the antiballistic missile ﬁgure
(AF IG) 1s directed to both the A=B and A=TOP logic blocks, while
an inverted version of the attack-missile ﬁgure (BFIG) IS directed to
blocks A=B, B=EDGE, and B=TARG. These are simply contact-
detection blocks described generally in Chapter 6. A=B generates a
pulse whenever the two missiles come into contact with one
another, A=TOP generates a pulse whenever the antiballistic mis-
sile reaches the top of the screen, B=EDGE generates a pulse
