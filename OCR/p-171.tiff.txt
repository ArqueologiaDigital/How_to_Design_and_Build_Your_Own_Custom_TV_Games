So what happens here is that the counter advances to its
maximum count (11111111, or decimal 256) where it is immediately
reloaded to the number appearing at the preset inputs of 1C1,
anywhere between 5 and 13. If the VC inputs show 1001, for
instance, the counter replaces 11111111 with 00001001, or decimal
9. It then counts up to 11111111, with a 16-count pause whenever
the VBLAN K interval occurs. The total number of counting intervals
in 1 complete cycle is thus 261, exactly equal to the number of
counting intervals generated by the Sourcebox vertical-count cir-
cuit. An image using the VM outputs stands still on the screen.

If the VC inputs are altered to show a binary number other than
9, the slipping counter has more or fewer counts per cycle. Loading
binary 8, for example, forces the slipping counter to work with one
additional HRST pulse per cycle. In effect, this increases the cycle
time, or in other words, decreases the frequency. The result in this
instance is that images generated by the VM outputs appear to move
upward on the screen.

Loading numbers larger than 9 shortens the counting cycle of
the slipping counter, thereby making it cycle at a higher frequency.
Any image using the VM outputs appears to move down the screen.

Construct the circuit in Fig. 5-13, and make your initial tests of
taking the video from one of the higher-order VM outputs, 32VM or
64VM for instance. The horizontal bars on the screen should stand
still when loading 1001 at the VC inputs. Then they should move
upward rather slowly when loading 1010 or 1011. The bars move at
the same speed, but upward, when loading 1000 or 0111 at the VC
inputs.

You are now in a good position to generate bars, lines, rectang-
les, and complex ﬁgures that show continuous vertical motion. Use
any of the procedures outlined in Chapters 3 and 4, substituting the
VM signals where you would normally specify the Sourcebox
V-count signals. Use the Sourcebox H—count signals in the usual
fashion until you have built the horizontal slipping counter described
in the section that follows.

If you have been conducting the vertical-motion experiments as
recommended thus far in this chapter, you are probably acutely
aware of the fact that the procedure for changing the speed and
direction of motion for the slipping counter is somewhat more awk-
ward that of the oscillator-controlled motion circuits.

The slipping-counter technique does not lend itself to direct
control by means of a simple variable resistor, whereas the simpler
control circuits do. The closing section of this chapter describes a
