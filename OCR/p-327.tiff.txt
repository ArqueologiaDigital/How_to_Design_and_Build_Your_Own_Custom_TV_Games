Fig. 8-10. Function table for the universal position programmer.

A particular count can be stopped and “remembered” by simply
setting RUN to logic 1 at the appropriate time. If desired, the count
can be resumed from that point by simply setting RUN to logic 0
agam.

Perhaps the best way to get a good feeling for how the universal
position programmer works is by building the circuit in Fig. 8-9 onto
a circuit board and interfacing it with the input controls shown in Fig.
8-11. Building the position programmer onto a circuit board will not
be a waste of time and effort because it will prove useful in some
TV-game designs later on. The input circuits can be built in a
breadboard fashion so that the parts can be used for other game
purposes.

For the sake of a preliminary set of experiments, connect the
comparator inputs 1 through 128 to their respective H—count signals
from the Sourcebox unit. This will provide an HPP output signal that
ultimately appears as a ﬁne, black vertical line on the screen. The
simple circuit in Fig. 8- 12 shows a technique for widening the bar and
changing it to white on black for easier viewing.

Experiments With a Position Programmer

To begin the experiments, set the STOP/RUN switch to the
logic-1 STOP position. Then set the nine PD input switches for some
desired bar position. In the context of the presentation in Chapter 3,
a logic—1 PD input is tantamount to a noninverted H-count signal,
while a logic-0 input yields the effect of using an inverted H-count
input.

Note there is no response on the screen while adjusting the
settings of the PD switches. This feature allows the experimenter to
