The primary—ﬁgure control codes are translated into velocities
in the VP column. This data is taken directly from the table in Fig.
7-22. The 2VP column then shows the VP ﬁgure multiplied by 2.
Multiplying a velocity vector changes only the speed and not the
direction, so the 4-bit binary words on the right-hand side of the table
in Fig. 7-23 show the control codes that suit the 2VP velocity
ﬁgures. Again, this data is taken directly from Fig. 7-22. The M’
column merely translates the control codes into their corresponding
decimal values.

What this table is saying is that when any primary ﬁgure is
carrying along a secondary ﬁgure with one velocity component of
M=12, the secondary ﬁgure should be launched with a velocity
component of M=15. The secondary ﬁgure will move away in the
same direction, but with twice the speed of the primary ﬁgure.

Primary-ﬁgure M ﬁgures greater than 12 or less than 3 are
considered invalid because the 2 x transformation calls for M’ values
that are greater or less than a 4-bit binary format allows. A ﬁgure
cannot go any faster than 1111 or 0000.

The circuit in Fig. 723 shows how the primary-ﬁgure data is
translated into a 2x format for its secondary ﬁgure. As long as the
primary control data stays within its valid operating range of M=5
through M=12, the circuit performs the prescribed transforma-
tions.

Interfacing this 2X vector circuit with the tagalong control
system is a matter of removing the jumpers speciﬁed in Fig. 7-13 and
connecting the PVC outputs of that circuit to the corresponding P
inputs of the 2 x vector circuit. The four outputs of the vector circuit
are then connected to their respective PVC’ connections in Fig.
7-13.

A second 2 x vector circuit can then be interfaced with the PH
connections in a similar fashion.

The secondary ﬁgure then tags along with its primary ﬁgure as
long as the FIRE terminal in Fig. 7-13 is at logic 1. Even though the
secondary ﬁgure is receiving control data that is different from the
control data for the primary ﬁgure, the secondary ﬁgure is effec—
tively initializedA the primary ﬁgure’s position.

Setting FIRE to logic 0, however, loads latches IC6 and IC7 in
Fig. 7-13 with the 2 X~transforrned~control data, and as a result, the
secondary ﬁgure ﬂies away at twice its host’s speed.
