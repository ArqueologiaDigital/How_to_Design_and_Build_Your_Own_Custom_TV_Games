Once the PLAY ﬂip-ﬂop is set in this fashion, the only way it can
be reset is by means of a negative-going pulse at the pin-5 input of
ICl-B. Two conditions must be met before this can happen, how-
ever. First, the ball counter must be showing numeral 5 as indicated
by a logic 0 level at the END input and the pin-3 input of NOR gate
IC6-A. Second, the ball must contact BE, the bottom edge of the
screen, as signaled by a negative-going pulse at the pin-9 output of
1C7. This pulse is effectively AN Ded with the E—N-ﬁ pulse at IC6-A to
produce a positive-going pulse that indicates the end of a game
sequence: end of play for the ﬁfth ball in the series.

That same end-of—game pulse is inverted to a negative-going
pulse by inverter IC9-E and ﬁnally resets the PLAY ﬂip-ﬂop so that
the next game can be started by depressing the PLAY pushbutton.

Once a game sequence is started, a new ball is la__ur_iched by
depressing the BALL button. This action sets the R-Sflip-ﬂop
composed of ICl—C and ICl-D. The pin—8 output of ICl-C is thus set
to logic 1, and that logic level is fed to a 4-input NAN D gate, IC4-B.

IC4-B considers four different game parameters simultane-
ously, and the only way its output can be set to logic 0 (its active
state) is by having the following parameters at logic 1: the PLAY
output of ICl—A, the BALL-LAUNCH output of ICl—C, the END
signal from the ball-counting circuit, and the TE contact signal from
pin 10 of 1C7. The output of this 4—input NAND gate is normally at
logic 1, dropping to 0 only when all four of these conditions are met.

Whenever the output_of IC4-B does drop to logic 0, it sets the
condition of yet another R-S f lip—ﬂop composed of ICZ-A and IC2-B.
Setting this particular ﬂip-ﬂop causes the output of IC2—A to go to
logic 1, thereby blanking the ball ﬁgure from the screen via the
BBLANK terminal of the control board.

Also note that a logic-0 level from IC4-B, the 4-input NAND
gate, both generates a BCOUNT pulse and resets the BALL-
LAUNCH ﬂip-ﬂop composed of ICl-C and ICl-D.

What does all this mean? One thing it means is that a newly
launched ball does not appear on the screen until it crosses TE while
moving downward. The ﬂip-ﬂop responsible for blanking the ball
ﬁgure is not set until 1C7 senses the ball ﬁgure crossing TE while
moving downward.

The same signal that unblanks the ball figure serves as a
BCOUNT pulse that increments the ball counter, thus advancing the
ball-count display on the screen. The BCOUNT pulse also resets the
BALL—LAUN CH ﬂip-ﬂop (speciﬁcally at pin 13 of ICl-D), preparing
it for the next ball-launching operation.
