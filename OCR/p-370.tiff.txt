The Stormtrooper board in Fig. 8-31 keeps track of the live
stormtroopers, generates the horizontal component of the
stormtrooper ﬁgures, and senses when they are all killed. 1C3 in Fig.
8-31 determines which one of the eight stormtroopers is hit and
changes the state of the appropriate J—K ﬂip-ﬂop, IC6—A through
IC9-B. Information from the “live” ﬂip-ﬂops is then recombined in
ICE to generate the horizontal component of the remaining
stormtroopers. 1C4 senses the condition where all eight
stormtroopers are killed before any of them reach the good guy’s
position at the bottom of the screen.

1C3 and 1C5 in Fig. 8- 31 make up an addressable de-
multiplexer/multiplexer combination having a set of eightJ- K ﬂip-
ﬂops standing between them. The demultiplexer and multiplexer
circuits are addressed from the same source of counting signals.
32H, 64H, and 128H. (The board’s 128H input is inverted by ICZ-B
before it is applied as the 128H address bit.) Since the demultiplexer
and multiplexer ICs are operated from the same three address lines,
it follows that they scan their data in precisely the same sequence.

These are 8- line devices. That is to say, the demultiplexer
(1C3) takes a single input line and splits the data into eight scanned
output lines. The multiplexer (1C5) works just the other way around,
accepting eight scanned inputs and reassembling them into a single
output line, SH or SH. The eight outputs from the demultiplexer go
to eight different J— K ﬂip- ﬂops, each representing the dead-or-alive
status of each stormtrooper. The active- high Q output of each
ﬂip-ﬂop then makes up an input line to the multiplexer.

Each address count represents the horizontal position of a
stormtrooper. When the address input—s to the demultiplexer/
multiplexer combination are 32H: 64H=128H=O, for example, the
beam on the screen is generating the horizontal component of the
first stormtrooper on the left. When the count changes to 32H=1,
64H=128H=0, the beam is scanning the second stormtrooper from
the left. This demultiplexer/multiplexer scanning process continues
through the eighth address combination, 32H=64H=128H =1, the
point on the screen representing the horizontal position of the last
stormtrooper on the right.

This addressing scheme thus scans the stormtroopers one at a
time, beginning at the left-hand end of the line. In Fig. 8-31, IC6-A
determines the dead-or-alive status of the ﬁrst stormtrooper, ICES-B
takes care of the second stormtrooper from the left, and so on
through IC9-B that determines the status of the last stormtrooper
on the right.
