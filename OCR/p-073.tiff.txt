64V or 6—3-43] signal to a second input of ICZ-B to make the rectangle
pull down farther from the top or up from the bottom.

Continue'adding more H and V inputs to their respective N AN D
gates until the resulting rectangle has the relative dimensions and
position you desire. I’ve called this asculpturz'ng technique because it
gave the experimenter a feeling of sculpturing or trimming a ﬁgure
on the screen.

The general procedure for sculpturing a rectangle on the screen
can be summarized in a basic “recipe.”

Recipe for Sculpturing a Rectangle or Square

Begin with a white screen, assuming it is actually a full—screen,
white rectangle.

1. Is that big white rectangle to be narrowed in from the left
right?
If from the left, use 2§§_I_-I__
If from the right, use 256H

2. Is the resulting vertical bar to be reduced down from the
top or upward from the bottom?
If from the top, use 128\[__
If from the bottom, use 128V

3. Is the resulting white square to be further narrowed from
the left or right?
If from the left, use IZ_S_l_l_
If from the right, use 128H

4. N ow is that white rectangle to be reduced downward from
the top or upward from the bottom?
If from the top, use 64V—
If from the bottom, use 64V

5. The white square can be sculptured further by alternately
reducing its horizontal and vertical size and position.

Simplifying the Final Rectangle Circuit

All of the rectangle-building circuits described thus far use at
least three inverter circuits, one from each of the line-generating
NAND gates and one at the output of the NAND gate that combines
the two lines. This circuit is quite appropriate when experimenting
with various ways to build a desired rectangle, but there happens to
be a simpler way to do the same job. This simpler operation calls for
using an IC that is not included on the Tinkerbox parts list, but it
ought to be speciﬁed in any ﬁnal circuit that is to be part of a
permanent game system.
