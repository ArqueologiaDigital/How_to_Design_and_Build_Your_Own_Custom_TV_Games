with black lines on a white background, by inverting the composite
signal before applying it to the GAME VID IN terminal of the
Sourcebox unit.

Figure 3-7b is a key circuit in designing all kinds of video games
and effects, so it should be clearly marked for future reference.

Building Narrow Lines More Efficiently

One of the features of the line-building procedure outlined thus
far in this chapter is that the Width of the line depends on the number
of horizontal— or vertical-count inputs used. The narrower the line is
supposed to be, the more inputs one must use.

Now this calls for using a lot of inputs to make very narrow
lines. It would be nice if there were some way to modify the
technique to reduce the number of count inputs required for making
narrow lines. Fortunately, there is such a technique, and it quite
often reduces the number of inputs to just two or three.

Figure 3-9 shows a T inkerbox technique for generating narrow
lines. Use the 8-input NAN D gate to determine the inputs required
for setting the position of the line. If you are working with a vertical
line, adjust the position of the white bar so that its left-hand edge
marks the place where the narrow line is to begin. When working
with vertical lines, the narrow line will begin at the top of the
position-determining white bar.

After setting the starting point of the narrow line as shown in
Fig. 3-9a, remove the output inverter stage, and connect the output
of the NAN D gate to a combination RC and logic circuit as shown in
Fig. 3-9b.

The output from the ﬁnal inverter stage in Fig. 3-9b is a white
line that begins at the same time the original white bar does, but it
ends at some time equal to or less than the original bar. The duration
(or width) of the line is determined by the time constant of compo-
nents R and C.

One convenient way to ﬁx the width of the line is by setting R
equal to 470 ohms and then varying the value of C until the line has
the desired Width. For vertical lines, the value of C will be on the
order of 0.002 “F. The value of R can be changed a little bit too, but
it should always remain between 100 and 470 ohms for the most
reliable operation.

In summary, the starting point of the narrow line is determined
by the starting point of a white bar, a white bar that is developed by
one of the recipes for vertical or horizontal bars. The cutoff time of
the line is then determined by the values of R and C in Fig. 3-9b.
