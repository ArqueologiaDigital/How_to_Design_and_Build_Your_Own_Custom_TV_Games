this chapter. The missile launching and initializing circuits, for exam-
ple, appear at the top of the schematic diagram. The six NAND gates
and two inverters are simply one-for-one combinations of the sim-
pler circuits speciﬁed in the block diagram for LAUNCH “A”, R-S
FLIP-FLOP, and “A” INIT.

IC8-A deﬁnes the vertical information for the antiballistic mis-
sile. And using the three VM inputs speciﬁed at the input of IC8-A, it
generates a movable horizontal bar that is 32VM pulses tall. The
horizontal position of the antiballisﬁc missile is taken from the point
on the screen where 256H makes the transition from black to white,
near the middle of the screen. This 256H signal from the Sourcebox
is inverted by IC6-C to create a negative-going edge that triggers
the pulse—shortening circuit composed of IC2-C and IC7—E. The
value of C2 determines the width of the image. A value of 0. 002 ,u.F is
speciﬁed here, but you might want to change that value to generate a
ﬁgure width more suitable to your own ideas about how the ﬁgure
should look.

The vertical and horizontal components for the antiballistic
missile ﬁgure are effectively ANDed together in IC5-A, and an
inverted (black-on—white) version of the ﬁgure is sent to a NAND
gate (IC3-C), where it is uprighted and combined with the attack-
missile ﬁgure.

The attack-missile ﬁgure is generated in a similar fashion. Its
movable horizontal components are deﬁned by the HM inputs to
IC9-A. This particular set of HM inputs create an image that is
32HM pulses long in the horizontal direction. You might want to
double its length by omitting the 32HM connection to IC9-A.

ICZ—D is responsible for ﬁxing the altitude of the attack missile.
The inputs in this case are 128V and 64V from the Sourcebox. These
particular inputs, working in conjunction with the pulse-shortening
circuit made up of IC3-A and IC7-B, create a thin horizontal line
about one-fourth the distance from the top of the screen. This ﬁxes
the altitude of the attack missile. The vertical height of the attack
missile can be adjusted by means of C3. ICS-B combines the horizon-
tal and vertical components of the attack-missile ﬁgure.

The attack—missile ﬁgure must pass through IC4-D before it can
be combined with the antiballistic missile at IC3-C. The image of the
attack missile will indeed appear at GAME VID OUT as long as pin
14 of IC4—D is at logic 1. If there is ever a contact between the two
missile images, as sensed by IC4-A, pin 14 of IC4-D drops to logic 0,
thereby blanking the image of the attack missile from the screen.

The attack missile then remains blanked until its “invisible”
image reaches the right-hand side of the screen, as deﬁned by
