Now suppose both missiles are launched, but the antiballistic
missile misses the attacker. In this instance, the antiballistic missile
continues its upward path until it reaches the top of the screen
(decision A 2 TOP). The moment A = TOP, the antiballistic mis—
sile is immediately reset to its initial position at the bottom of the
screen, and Player A is free to reprogram the horizontal position and
launch again.

One of two things happen to the attack missile if the antiballistic
missile misses it. The best thing, as far as Player B is concerned, is
that his missile hits the target in the lower right-hand corner of the
screen. This is the B=TARG condition. When that happens, the
target ﬂashes to indicate a clean hit.

Whether the attack missile hits the target or not, it continues its
path across the screen until it reaches the B=EDGE condition. The
“EDGE” is deﬁned as a line along the right-hand side and bottom of
the screen. If Player A misses the attack missile and Player B misses
the target, the attack missile will either fall short (hit the bottom of
the screen) or overshoot (hit the right—hand side of the Screen.)

In any case, the attack missile is immediately reset to its initial
position upon reaching the right-hand edge or bottom of the screen.

The attack missile, incidentally, is blanked from the screen as
long as it is in its initial position. This feature allows Player B to adjust
the initial launch altitude without tipping his hand to Player A. The
antiballistic missile is never blanked from the screen.

Player Controls

Figure 7-2 shows the control panel and other relevant features
for the antiballistic missile, Player A. Player A adjusts the horizontal
position of the antiballistic missile anywhere in 16 different positions
along the bottom of the screen.

The idea is to set switches SF through SI to 1 of 16 different
combinations of 1s and 0s, then momentarily depress the LOAD
pushbutton. The ﬁgure of the antiballistic missile responds by mov-
ing to the position speciﬁed by the switches. A bit of work with these
switches will show exactly how they work.

The antiballistic missile can be launched from its initial position
by depressing the LAUNCH pushbutton. Once the missile is
launched, all switches and buttons are locked out, making it impossi-
ble to change the path of the antiballistic missile until it is automati-
cally reset (by striking the attack missile or the top of the screen).

The attack missile control panel is somewhat more complex
because Player B has more initial parameters to control. See Fig.
7-3.
