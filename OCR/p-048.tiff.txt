The NAN D gate, followed by an inverter circuit, performs an
essential operation as far as building static ﬁgures is concerned. In
the ﬁrst place, you have already seen that this circuit yields an output
that shows a white bar wherever the white bars at the input of the
NAND gate overlap. And now it is time to study a second essential
feature of this NAND/invert combination.

Any black or white bar from one of the basic horizontal— or
vertical-count sources is always divided equally by a black/white
alternation of the next-lower-order signal. Although this might seem
to be a rather obscure fact at the moment, it is important you
understand it thoroughly. So try an example with your Tinkerbox
arrangement.

Feed 3 256H signal to the input of the NAND gate and note the
signal on the TV screen as generated at the output of the inverter. It
should be the now-fannliar 256H vertical pattern: a black space
turning to white just left of center. Now apply the next lower-order
H signal, 128H, to a second input of the inverter. That new
waveform should cut the 256H pattern in half. It divides the white
portion of 256H into equal-sized black and white—black ﬁrst, then
White.

This demonstrates the fact that any basic horizontal- or
vertical-count display has its white section(s) cut in half by a black/
white alternation of the next-lower-count input. The black section of
256H is, incidentally, being cut in two also. But since this particular
NAND/invert combination yields only overlapping white areas, the
division of the black section cannot be seen on the screen.

To check your understanding of this principle, what do you
suppose will happen when you add a third input, speciﬁcally 64H, to
the NAN D gate circuit? If 256H and 128H are already there, the 64H
input should cut the white area of 128H in half—black ﬁrst, then
white.

The next-lower-order H signal is 32H; and if it is included as a
fourth input to the NAND gate, it cuts the bar in half again. This
procedure can continue until all eight inputs on the N AN D gate are
used.

While running this experiment, notice that the white bar on the
screen seems to grow narrower as each input is added. Further-
more, it is narrowing from the left-hand side. The right-hand side is
remaining ﬁxed. Bear this effect in mind while considering the next
set of experiments.

Remove all inputs to the 8—input NAND gate except 256 H. The
image on the screen should then be the standard black-to-white
256H signal. Apply the 128H signal again, but run it through an
