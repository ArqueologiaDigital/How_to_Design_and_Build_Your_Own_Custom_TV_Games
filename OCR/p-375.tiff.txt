So there are three basic elements that make up the
stormtroopers’ beams. ICl-A and the two timers determine when
the stormtroopers ﬁre and the duration of their volley, ICl-B and
IC6-A determine the horizontal position and width of each beam,
while ICl-C and ICl-D ﬁx the position and length of the beam in the
vertical plane. All three of these Stormtrooper beam parameters are
NANDed together at IC4—A, resulting in the complete video infor—
mation for that part of the game.

A dead stormtrooper, incidentally, cannot ﬁre a round at the
good guy simply because the SH pulse at ICl-B cannot occur. That
particular pulse is eliminated at the Stormtrooper board.

Whenever the good guy depresses his FIRE button, the timer
circuit on the Figure board (1C3 in Fig. 8—30) generates a GFP pulse
that lasts about 0. 5 second. This positive-going level is fed to pin 3 of
IC4-B to determine the good guy’s ﬁring-time interval.

The R-S ﬂip-ﬂop built around ICZ-B and ICZ-C ﬁxes the vertical
length of the good guy’s beam. The SV input to this ﬂip-ﬂop always
starts the good guy’s beam at the line of stormtroopers, and the GV
input ends the beam at the good guy’s position. The good guy’s beam
is actually drawn from the line of stormtroopers to the good guy, but
the visual impression is that the good guy is ﬁring upward on the
screen, and it is a visual impression that is more important in this
case.

The pulse generator composed of ICZ-D and IC6-C ﬁx the
ho'ﬂontal position of the good guy’s beam. The circuit operates from
a CH signal, making the beam appear from the left-hand edge of the
good-guy ﬁgure. The good guy, in other words, is a southpaw.

You should be able to see that the good guy’s beam circuit is
practically identical to that of the stormtroopers. The only real
difference is that the stormtroopers ﬁre automatically after a 0.1-
second delay, whereas the good guy ﬁres at any time the play
depresses the FIRE pushbutton.

The good guy’s beam parameters are all combined in IC4-B to
create his beam video signal. The width of the good guy’s beam is
determined by the value of CS.

Thus far we have accounted only for the two beam ﬁgures
generated at the Control board. We have yet to see exactly how the
good—guy and stormtrooper video signals are assembled.

_The _h_o_rizontal and vertical components of the good-guy ﬁgure
(GH and GV) are effectively AN Ded at IC7-B, then passed to the
blanking gate, IC2-A. An active-low version of the good-guy ﬁgure
emerges from IC2—A as long as the pin-1 input to that gate is resting
