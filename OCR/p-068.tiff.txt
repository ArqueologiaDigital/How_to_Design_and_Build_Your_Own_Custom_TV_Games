IC is connected to COMM (at logic 0) the white line appears at the
same place on the screen it had before the EXCLUSIVE—OR gates
were installed. But connecting that control line to +5V (logic 1), the
line shifts to the right of center.

What is happening here is a reversal of the horizontal-count
sequence as the NAND gate sees it. Reversing or inverting the
outputs from any digital counter circuit makes it appear to count
backwards. So when the control input to the EXCLUSIVE-OR gates
is a logic 0, the NAND gate sees the H-count inputs arriving in their
normal up-coming sequence. Setting the control input to logic 1,
however, creates the effect of a counter that is running backwards.
In a sense, the NAND gate is fooled into reacting as though the
horizontal count is running from right to left across the screen.

Now connect the control input of the circuit to 256H. You will
ﬁnd a pair of parallel vertical lines on the screen. This image is
something like a mirror image. The line on the left is the real image,
and the one on the right is its reﬂection. Unfortunately the dividing
line is at the point where 256H changes from black to white, and that
point is always a bit left of center.

Used with H—count line drawings, the foldover technique yields
a double pattern, with the right—hand half being a mirror image of the
left-hand side.

The trick works even better with vertical—count signals because
the 128V dividing line is closer to the center of the screen.

Create any pattern of horizontal parallel lines on the left side of
the screen, then run the inputs to their line-generating NAN D gates.
Using 256B as the control input, the result is a mirror image on the
right side of the screen. Try using 128H as the control and you will
ﬁnd the pattern repeating itself several times across the screen.

This foldover technique can be used for generating a broad
white bar if the inputs to the line-generating NAN D gate are
speciﬁed so that they create a white bar that ends at the line where
256H changes from black to white. The mirror image of a white bar
ending at that line effectively extends the bar across that point and an
equal distance into the right-hand side of the screen. The same sort
of thing happens when folding over a horizontal white bar.

Using the foldover technique is purely optional at this point.
The ﬂip-ﬂop techniques are equally effective and often more effi—
cient. Compare the two methods as shown in Fig. 3—16. Both circuits
generate exactly the same horizontal white ba_r across the center of
the screen. The scheme in Fig. 3-16a uses a R—Sflip-ﬂop, while the
one in Fig. 3—16b uses the foldover technique.
