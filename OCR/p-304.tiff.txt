build the ﬁgures from the negative-going edges of the high-order bit
on all four slipping counters. This rather simple procedure is im-
plemented by the eight pulse generator circuits in Fig. 7-26.

The trickiest part of this circuit is interpreting the meaning of
the input designations. A256PHM at pin 1 of ICl—A, for instance,
represents the 256HM output of Player A’s primary figure
horizontal-slippng counter. By the same token, A128PVM is Player
A’s 128VM signal from his primary-ﬁgure vertical-slipping counter.

The outputs of these two pulse generators are effectively
ANDed together in IC4-A to generate Player A’s primary-aircraft
figure. The selected values of C1 and C2 determined the horizontal
and vertical dimensions of that particular ﬁgure. The experimenter is
free to select values that suit his own impression of how large the
aircraft ﬁgures should be.

Inputs A256SHM and AIZSSVM are the high—order counter
outputs from Player A’s secondary-ﬁgure slipping counters. After
shortening these pulses with a set of pulse generators, they are
combined in IC4-B to yield the missile ﬁgure for Player A.

Player B’s slipping-counter signals are handled in the same
fashion, producing his missile ﬁgure from ICE-A and his aircraft
figure from ICS-B.

IC3—A in Fig. 7-26 senses contact between Player B’s missile
and A’s aircraft. This is, in other words, the BM=AC LOGIC shown
in the block diagram in Fig. 7 -24. In the same way, IC3-B signals any
contact between Player B’s aircraft and A’s missile.

A contact between a missile and the opponent’s aircraft initiates
a timer circuit which, in turn, causes the image of the stricken
aircraft to ﬂash on and off. Timer IC8—A, for instance, is initiated
whenever B’s missile contacts A’s aircraft. ICS-B is then allowed to
oscillate, alternately gating A’s images on and off at IC4—D.

IC9‘A is another timer that controls oscillator ICQ-B. The
action of these two devices is initiated whenever there is contact
between A’s missile and B’s aircraft.

The two pairs of images (Player A’s aircraft and missile, and B’s
aircraft and missile) are combined at IC3-C to yield the games
video-output signal.

AMRST and BMRST are set to logic 0 whenever a missile
scores, thereby returning the missle to its host aircraft.

One very important feature that might be easily overlooked is the
fact that the PINTP connections on the two tagalong systems are
