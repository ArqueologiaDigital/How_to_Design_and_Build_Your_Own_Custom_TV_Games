the designer as well as others who have an opportunity to enjoy
them.

The game systems as they are presented here might seem
rather cumbersome compared to the slick, cassette-programmed
game systems on the market today. But how creative can one be
with someone else’s prescribed programs? Sure it is possible to get a
dozen games on one program tape, but it really doesn’t take long to
want more. The game-design scheme presented in this book is
wholly open-ended—there is no real limit to the number and types of
games that can come from it. It’s all a matter of learning how to
design the games and exercising some degree of creativity and
imagination.

It is not necessary to have a great deal of know-how concerning
digital electronics to begin the work in this book. The ﬁrst few
chapters have been planned with the digital novice in mind. As the
work progresses, however, the need for learning more about basic
digital electronics becomes more apparent. Unfortunately, a book of
this size cannot stand up as both a design manual for Video games and
a text book on basic digital electronics.

While the information regarding game design is thus adequate
for building custom games of any sort, a reader not fully acquainted
with basic digital electronics will eventually become lost without the
aid of a good digital reference text. This, however, should not
discourage a beginner in the digital business. Rather, it should
provide some motivation and direction for learning more about digital
electronics in general.

What better way to learn digital electronics than by seeing each
newly learned fact transformed into moving image on the TV
screen?
