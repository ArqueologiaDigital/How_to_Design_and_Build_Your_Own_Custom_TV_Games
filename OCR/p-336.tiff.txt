As shown in Fig. 8-16, the player has a set of adjustments
labeled UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT. After teeing up the ball by
depressing the TEE pushbutton, the player sets the controls for the
relative speed and direction he wants the ball to take. When he is
satisﬁed with those adjustments, he then depresses the SWING
pushbutton. That action launches the ball, and it travels across the
screen-presumably toward the green and hole—for a ﬁxed period
of time.

When the ball comes to a stop, the player adjusts the controls
again, then depresses the SWING button. He continues this se-
quence until the ball “falls into the hole.” When he makes the hole,
the game is locked out, and can be resumed only by depressing the
TEE pushbutton again. This action brings the programming feature
into play: the;position of the ball is initialized on a new tee position,
and the player faces an entirely different situation.

The screen diagram in Fig. 8-16 shows just one of the nine
different initial positions for the ball and green. After making the
ninth hole, the 9-hole cycle begins all over again.

Besides demonstrating a compelling application of the
position-programming circuits, this game includes some new ideas
about ﬁgure—speed control.

As stated earlier, the ball travels for a ﬁxed period of time after
the player depresses the SWING pushbutton. As long as the ball is
not on the green, it travels at a relatively high velocity, but once on
the green, its speed is cut in half and it moves for a shorter period of
time.

The ball color also changes as it moves onto the green. Nor~
mally the ball appears as a small white square. The green is also
white. But when the ball reaches the green, the ball color changes
from white to black.

The golf game, as described here, has no obstacles on the
course, but the circuit boards include some terminals for adding
obstacles later on. Numerals indicating the hole and score can also be
added at a later time.

Golf Block Diagram

The basic block diagram for this Golf game is shown in Fig.
8-17. When the player operates the TEE switch, the program
counter advances to set up a new position for the green and hole.
The ball position is also initialized at a point determined by the
program counter and BALL H INITIAL POSITION logic.

The ball then remains initialized until the player depresses the
SWING switch. Depressing the SWING switch starts the BALL
