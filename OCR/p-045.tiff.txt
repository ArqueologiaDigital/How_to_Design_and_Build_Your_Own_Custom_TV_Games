So what is accomplished by the simple circuit in Fig. 3-4a? Not
much in terms of building images for TV games. But the circuit does
clearly demonstrate two important facts: a NAN D gate inverts logic
levels (and hence reverses blacks and whites), and doubly inverting
a signal returns it ot its original phase.
