trouble identifying the object presented on the screen. Even with 64
cells available for building an image, the resolution is often so coarse
that others might, indeed, have trouble seeing what the image is
supposed to represent. When this is the case, it is time to move up to
a matrix generator that yields a higher resolution.

The circuit in Fig. 4-17 uses two 16:1 multiplexer circuits. The
basic system generates 32 cells. (Note that there are 32 D inputs,
labeled DO through D31.) If the matrix—extension technique is
applied to this circuit, the number of available cells rises to 64. And if
the foldover technique is also used, the system can generate a
128-cell symmetrical ﬁgure.

This system represents a 2:1 increase in image resolution over
the basic 16-cell circuit in Fig. 4-5.

1C6 and 1C6 are identical ICs. In fact they are the same multi-
plexer IC used for all of the complex-ﬁgure circuits already described
in this chapter. Note, however, that this system has ﬁve select
inputs, SO through S4, while each multiplexer IC has input provisions
for only four.

We can take care of the four basic select inputs on each multi-
plexer IC by connecting them in parallel: pin 15 of ICE to pin 15 of
1C6, pin 14 of IC5 to pin 14 of 1C6, and so on. The parallel-connected
select inputs on the two multiplexer ICs then go to system-select
inputs SO through 83.
