the whole affair four times as complicated! If anything useful is to be
done ‘with this matter of rotating complex ﬁgures in a realistic
fashion, there has to be a special trick for simplifying the whole thing.
That trick is 90° rotations.

The previous analysis of the rotation sequence in Fig. 11-10
showed that it could be done with four programmed ﬁgures (0°, 90°,
45°, and 225°) by reversing the horizontal or vertical counting to
obtain the other four ﬁgures. Using a 90°-shift operation, however,
it is possible to generate all eight ﬁgures from just two matrix
programs, the 0° and 45° images.

While the sequence in Fig. 11-10 is built around 45° incre—
ments, it can be seen that the 0° image can be shifted by 90° to get
the images for 90, 180, and 270 degrees, while the 45° image can be
shifted in 90° increments to get the images for 135, 225 and 315
degrees. Using this 90°-shift technique, it is possible to get all eight
frames from the D-input matrix programs for 0° and 45°. And in fact
a 16-frame rotation sequence (221/2° intervals) can be derived from
just four D-input matrix programs.

Figure 11—11 shows the rationale behind rotating a single 4 x 4
matrix image in 90° increments by varying the select format, rather
than the D-input programming. In this case, the basic 0° matrix is
generated in the usual fashion, applying the least-signiﬁcant H—count
bit (H0) to SD of the matrix generator, the most-signifcant H-count
(H1) to SI, and so on. The numerals in the matrix cells indicate their
relative positions, with the ﬁrst digit being the decimal value of select
inputs SO and SI, and the second being the decimal value of the bits
applied to select inputs 52 and 83.

Achieving a 90° clockwise rotation from the basic matrix is a
matter of shifting the counts around the matrix. In the 90° ﬁgure, 00
replaces, 03, 03 replaces 33, and so on. Any complex ﬁgure con-
structed within the 0° matrix will appear shifted 90° clockwise if it is
again constructed in the 90° matrix.

Making this 90° shift calls for applying the two V-count inputs to
what is normally considered the H—count inputs, SO and 81. Fur-
thermore, the H—count bits are inverted before applying them to 82
and 53 of the matrix generator, effectively reversing their direction
of count.

Another 90° shift in the clockwise direction takes us to the 180°
matrix, where the H- and V-count bits are applied to their usual
select inputs, but inverted to force both to count in reverse. A ﬁnal
90° shift yields the matrix for 270°. The connections to the select
inputs are similar to those required for the 90° image, but in this case
it is the V—count inputs that run in reverse.
