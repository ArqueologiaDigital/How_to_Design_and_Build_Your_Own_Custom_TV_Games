So when 256H is at logic 0, IC8—C is gated off, and the inversion
of IC8-A inverts 256H to gate on IC8-B. Theﬁ output is thus
enabled in its active-low format. When 256H goes to logic 1, signify-
ing the right-hand half of the screen is being serviced, IC8-C is
enabled and IC8—B is effectively switched off.

That completes the theory of operation of the ﬁgure- generator
portion of this pinball game.
