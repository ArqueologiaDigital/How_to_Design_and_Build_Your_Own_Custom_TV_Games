Chapter 11
Animation and
Rotation of Complex Figures

 

Figure animation and rotation belong to a class of special effects that
is seldom critical to the operation of a Video game system. These
effects can, however, lend a special touch of interest that heightens
the players’ sense of reality.

The circuits suggested in this chapter can actually be applied
without reference to any particular game. Most experimenters will
agree that building the complex ﬁgures in Chapter 4 offered a unique
opportunity to create some fascinating images on the screen. Now
there is the chance to add-the dimension of motion, animation and
rotation, to them.

Figure rotation is a special class of motion calling for rotating the
ﬁgure on the screen about an imaginary axis extending at right angles
to the plane of the screen—in and out of the screen. One of the more
common ﬁgure rotation effects can be found in connection with a
popular commercial combat game where two tanks chase each other
around the screen. The tank ﬁgure moves only in a forward direc-
tion; the player has the ability to rotate the ﬁgure, making it possible
to move it in virtually any direction.

This ﬁgure—rotation feature is actually a form of animation, but
as demonstrated later in this chapter, it is a form of ﬁgure animation
and motion that calls for an unusually high degree of system planning.

An experimenter cannot hope to master the fundamentals of
ﬁgure animation and rotation without first getting a complete under—
standing of how complex ﬁgures are built in a matrix format. Readers
