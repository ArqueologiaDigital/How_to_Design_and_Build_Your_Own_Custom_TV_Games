Sketch the ﬁgure you want by darkening the appropriate cells
on the matrix pattern, adjust the select and window as desired, and
specify the D inputs according to your sketch and the four
extended- matrix rules described earlier in this section.

It 1s often helpful to build the original ﬁgure using a relatively
large- scale matrix. After you are satisﬁed with the speciﬁcations,
scale it down to size by lowering the order of the select mputs. The
question mark in Fig. 4 10a, for example, turns out to be a rather
large ﬁgure when built according to the select and window speciﬁca-
tions shown in that diagram. It can be reduced 1n size a considerable
amount by setting the select speciﬁcations to 4H, ﬂ 4V, and 8V,
then setting the window to something like 256H, 128H, 64H, 32H,
16H, 126V, 64V, _and 32V. The V— count sign__al to the D 1nputs should
be 16V and 16V, rather than 64V and 64Vused for the larger
version

While you are having fun with this question mark, why not try
something else? Use the small-ﬁgure select and D inputs as just
described. But instead of using the 8-input NAN D gate to generate
the little window, try replacing the NAND gate with an
EXCLUSIVE- OR gate. Run 32H and 32V signals to the inputs of the
EXCLUSIVE- OR gate, and connect the output of that gate to the CE
terminal of the multiplexer. Cute, eh?

Folding Over an Extended Matrix

The matrix-extension procedure doubles the number of cells
available for building matrix-oriented ﬁgures. That particular
technique has no restrictions on the type of ﬁgures that can be
generated, and it calls for no more hardware than is required for a
basic matrix-generating circuit.

A matrix foldover scheme described here doubles the number
of cells once again. A basic 4 x4 matrix, for instance, can be doubled
to a 4 X8 pattern by means of the matrix- extension procedure, and it
can then be doubled to an 8X8 matrix by applying a foldover
technique.

There are some restrictions on the kind of ﬁgure that can be
generated under foldover conditions, however, and the technique
requires some additional EXCLUSIVE-OR gates. In spite of the
restrictions and extra hardware, the foldover technique pays off
quite often.

The diagrams in Fig. 4—11 show the 8X8 extended foldover
matrix pattern as well as the extra circuitry that must be added to the
basic 4x4 matrix generator in Fig. 4-5.
