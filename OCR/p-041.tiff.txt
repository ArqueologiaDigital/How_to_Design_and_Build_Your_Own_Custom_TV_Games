A ﬁgure for 256V is not shown here because it does not make a
very interesting picture. It is at logic 0 through all but the last four
lines of the display. Figure 3-1 does show what you should expect to
see from 128V, 64V, 32V, and 16V.

While inspecting these ﬁgures for yourself, take careful note of
the fact that the bars for 64H and 64V are very close to the same
size. The same is true for 32H and 32V, 16H and 16V, etc. From
64H and 64V downward, the lines are about the same size when
comparing an H output with its vertical counterpart.

There is, however, an obvious difference between the sizes of
the bars for 128H and 128V, and 256H and 256V. Keep these facts in
mind for a time when you will be considering your own ﬁgure-
building procedures.

An experimenter can be justifiably proud of his system when
seeing these basic horizontal— and vertical—count bars for the ﬁrst
time. A lot of work and money has gone into building the Sourcebox,
and this is the ﬁrst solid result of all that work. But looking at these
bars and lines can become rather boring after a while. So now it is
time to begin using these lines and bars as mere building blocks for
creating more-useful and interesting ﬁgures.

THE LINE/BAR TINKERBDX

Figure 3—2 shows a schematic diagram, physical layout, and
parts list for a breadboard system we shall call the Line/ Bar Tinker-
box. It is simply a selection of ICs that are most useful for creating
certain lines and bars at desired positions on the screen. The main
purpose of this Tinkerbox is to let the experimenter ﬁnd out exactly
what IC devices are necessary for building a desired line or bar on
the screen. After taking careful note of how it is done with the
Tinkerbox, the experimenter can transfer the ideas to a permanent
cirucit.

The ICs are plugged into a standard breadboard and bus-strip
assembly. (See the parts list in Fig. 3—2 for catalog numbers.) The
breadboard assembly is connected to the Sourcebox unit via a
multiconductor cable or bundle of wires. These wires are connected
to the Sourcebox output connector by means of a standard 22-pin
edge-card PC board. Figure 3-3 shows a connection diagram that
corresponds with the Sourcebox output terminal conﬁguration de—
scribed in Chapter 2.

To get a feeling for what the Tinkerbox can do and how to use it,
connect the circuit shown in Fig. 8—4a. In this case, 256H is con-
nected to pin 1 of 1C3, the 8-input NAND gate. If a test jumper is
