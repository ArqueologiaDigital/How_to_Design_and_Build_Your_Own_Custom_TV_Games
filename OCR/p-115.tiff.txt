practice it turns out that an experimenter can generate a vast variety
of interesting and useful video game ﬁgures with it. How about that
cowboy ﬁgure speciﬁed in Fig. 4—24?

Turn your imagination loose on this matrix and see how many
fascinating symmetrical ﬁgures you can generate. The principles for
designing ﬁgures around this 8X16 extended foldover matrix with
vertical symmetry are much the same as those for working out
