Figure 4—20 shows how the extended 64-cell square matrix can
be transformed into a 16 x4 matrix format. This long and narrow
matrix can be useful for generating game ﬁgures such as side views
of ships, cars, and aircraft. See the two examples in Fig. 4-21.
NOTE: The complex ﬁgure generated by the programming connec-
tions in Fig. 4-21a calls for 21 connections from the 8V source. Since
the Sourcebox can deliver sufﬁcient power for only 20 loads, the load
must be divided by means of the buffer circuit shown in Fig. 4—21a.
The 8V Sourcebox connection goes to the input of the ﬁrst inverter.
The output of one of the two other inverters goes to about half the
8V connections speciﬁed for this ﬁgure. The other half come from
the output of the third inverter.

The horizontally oriented 16 x4 matrix can be likewise restruc-
tured to form a vertical, 4 x 16 matrix. See Fig. 4-22. This particular
matrix might not be very useful as it is speciﬁed here, but it becomes
an invaluable starting point for building a highly desirable 8x16
extended foldover matrix described in the following section.

Before leaving this discussion of extended 64-cell matrices, it is
important to see how they differ from the 64-cell extended foldover
versions described in the opening sections of this chapter.

At ﬁrst glance, 8 x 8 extended foldover matrix in Fig. 4—13 might
appear identical to the 8 x8 extended matrix in Fig. 4-18. Likewise,
the vertical 4 X 16 extended foldover matrix in Fig. 4—15 looks much
like the 4x16 extended matrix in Fig. 4-22.

Since these matrices have the same number of cells and the
same general dimensions, why would an experimenter ever resort
to the versions that use the more complicated circuit in Fig. 4-17?
The simpler circuits are using a foldover technique to double the
number of matrix cells, and that means the ﬁgures must be symmet-
rical about the foldover line. The matrices generated by the more
complicated circuit in Fig. 4-17, on the other hand, do not use this
foldover scheme; therefore, the ﬁgures are not limited to those
having a symmetrical display. The nonsymmetrical ﬁgure of a dog in
Fig. 4-19, for instance, cannot possibly be built within the 8x8
extended foldover matrix in Fig. 4-13. Figures using the matrix in
Fig. 4-13 must be symmetrical about a horizontal line running
through the middle of it.

A Useful 128-cell, Extended Foldover Matrix

Adding a 7486 quad EXCLUSIVE—OR IC package to the circuit
in Fig. 4-17 makes it possible to generate a large foldover matrix that
