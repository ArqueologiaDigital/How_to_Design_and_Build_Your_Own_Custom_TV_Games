A slightly different approach to generating broad white bars
calls for a special IC device, a 7474 dual D ﬂip-ﬂop. Figure 3-13
shows the basic layout and truth table for this nice little device.

In the context of drawing wide bars on the screen, the D-type
ﬂip-ﬂop works like a short-term memory circuit that remembers
whatever logic level (1 or 0) is present at its D input the instant its
CLK input makes a transition from 1 to 0. The Q output responds
directly to any changes at the D input as long as CLK is at logic 0. As
soon as CLK returns to logic 0, however, the circuit “remembers”
the D input it saw just before that 1-to-0 transition took place at
CLK. D remains ﬁxed at that output level until CLK is pulled up to
logic 1 again.

The simple circuit in Fig. 3-14 is just one example of how a D
ﬂip-ﬂop can be used for generating a wide, white vertical bar on the
screen. The D input in this instance is an inverted version of the
256H signal. The CLK input is 128H.

Whenever 128H is at logic 1 (white) any logic level present at
the D input is transferrred immediately to the Circuit’s Q output. The
ﬁrst time 128H goes white in Fig. 3-14, it so happens 256H is white;
thus, the circuit generates a white bar that begins as 128H goes
white the ﬁrst time.

The output then remains white while 128H makes an alterna-
tion from white to black. The second time 128H goes white, 256H
has switched to black, so the output of the D ﬂip-ﬂop circuit is
switched to logic 0 (black on the screen). __

It is left to the experimenter to decide whether the R-S or
D-type ﬂip—ﬂop is best under speciﬁc conditions. Neither is better
under all circumstances.

Building Broad Bars and Multiple Parallel Lines by Foldover

There is yet another technique for building bars and parallel
lines on the screen. This technique still uses the basic Tinkerbox
approach to getting things started, but it calls for an additional IC to
complete the job.

Understand from the outset that this foldover technique is
useful only under certain circumstances described later in this sec-
tion. Usually it is simpler and more effective to use a straight
Tinkerbox, RC-modiﬁed, or ﬂip—ﬂop-modiﬁed technique. The fold-
over procedure is presented here for two reasons: ﬁrst, it com-
pletes the list of possible ways to generate bars and lines; and
second, it introduces a digital principle that Will become especially
