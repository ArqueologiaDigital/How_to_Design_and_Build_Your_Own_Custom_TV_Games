Fig. 7-20. Flowcharts for Dogﬁght.

So the overall picture looks something like this. There are two
aircraft ﬂying freely around the screen. A player can ﬁre a missile
from his craft, and that missile ﬁgure leaves the primary craft in the
same direction, but at twice the speed. The missile can ﬂy for about 1
second before it is blanked from the screen and returned to the
primary craft. If that missile happens to strike the opponent’s craft
enroute, the opponent’s craft is destroyed (ﬂashed) and the missile
is returned to its primary ﬁgure once again.

The game can go on indeﬁnitely because this particular version
has no provisions for keeping score and automatically resetting the
game. These features can be added at a later time.

The two identical control panels are quite simple, consisting
only of a firing button and a set of ﬂight-path controls. The two
potentiometers shown in Fig. 7—21 can be replaced with a joystick
control to produce simpler and more realistic interaction between
the control panels and activity on the screen.

Vector Logic

This Dogﬁght game is built around two identical sets of tagalong
systems, one set for each player. And that means the experimenter
must be prepared to install four slipping-counter boards (Fig. 5-15)
and two tagalong-control boards (Fig. 7 - 13).

The secondary ﬁgures in both systems tagalong with the prim-
ary ﬁgures in the usual fashion until a player launches his missile. The
