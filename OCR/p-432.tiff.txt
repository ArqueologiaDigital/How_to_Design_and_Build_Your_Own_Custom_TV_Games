The left and right edges of the playing area are generated as a
single unit at IC5—A and IC6—D. They must be separated for rebound-
ing purposes, however. This is accomplished by gating IC8-C with
256H and IC8—B with a version of 256H that is ﬁrst inverted by
IC8—A. It makes some sense that the system is generating the
left-hand side of the playing area when 256H is at logic 0 and it is
generating the right-hand half when 256H = 1.
