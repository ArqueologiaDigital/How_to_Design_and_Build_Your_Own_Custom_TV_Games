The horizontal- and vertical-motion codes are generated by a
pair of quad 2:1 data multiplexers, 1C3 and 1C4. The experimenter
can program the directions and rates as desired, and the R-S ﬂip-
ﬂops automatically select the codes whenever a contact takes place.

The UP PROGRAM inputs to 1C3 must be connected to a
combination of 1s and Os that will set the ﬁgure motion in an upward
direction and at a rate determined by the experimenter. Likewise,
the DOWN PROGRAM inputs ﬁx the rate of motion in the down-
ward direction. The same general idea applies to the RIGHT and
LEFT PROGRAM inputs to the horizontal-motion selector, 1C4.

The table in Fig. 10-4 shows the recommended pairs of UP and
DOWN or RIGHT and LEFT program inputs. If the experimenter
programs downward motion using 0101 for example, the UP
PROGRAM should be 1101 after contact is made. Compare the data
in this table with the master-control table in Fig. 7-22.

Figure 10-5 is a block diagram of a complete horizontal. and
vertical-motion rebounding circuit. Inverted versions of the top,
bottom, right, left, and movable ﬁgure are generated at the FIGURE
BOARD. The diagram assumes the ﬁxed and movable ﬁgures are
ORed to yield the composite-ﬁgure video.

The REBOUND CONTROL BOARD (Fig. 10—3) senses any
contact between the movable ﬁgure and a rebound object and then
adjusts the horizontal- and vertical-control codes fed to a standard
slipping-counter board (Fig. 5-15). The velocity of the ball is ﬁxed by
the program inputs to the REBOUND CONTROL BOARD.

The circuit in Fig. 10-6 is a sample ﬁgure-generator for the
rebound control scheme described here. The ﬁgure in this case is a
black ﬁeld of play surrounded by a white border. A small rectangle,
4H x 4V moves about in the black ﬁeld, rebounding from the top,
bottom, and sides of the ﬁeld. The circuit can be built on a bread-
board arrangement in a rather short time. And if the suggested ball
speed programming parameters listed in Fig. 10-6 are ﬁxed at the
designated inputs of the rebound control board, Fig. 10-3, the ball
bounces around at a fairly high speed.

A PINBALL GAME

A video pinball game relies heavily on rebound effects. The
game illustrated here represents only one of many possible pinball
games, and it ties together some of the main features of game
controls, ﬁgure generators, and scoring. The main emphasis is on
the rebounding effects, however, with weighted scoring being a
close second.
