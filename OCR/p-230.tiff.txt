forcing the secondary ﬁgure to follow the primary ﬁgure wherever it
goes. And that is the main feature of the tagalong scheme—force the
secondary counter to work in step with the primary-ﬁgure counter.

Whenever the INTC input to the secondary initialization circuit
is set to logic 1, however, the secondary horizontal-slipping counter
begins taking reset pulses from its own reset circuit, thereby letting
it run independent of the primary counter. The secondary ﬁgure thus
takes off on its own, running away from the primary ﬁgure at a
direction and speed determined by the HC inputs to the secondary
counter.

The secondary ﬁgure can be “reattached” to the primary ﬁgure
by simply returning INTC to logic 0 once again.

Since both the primary and secondary ﬁgures are locked to
horizontal motion only, the vertical data for determining their re—
spective lengths can be taken direction from the Sourcebox Vocount
outputs.

A scheme for launching a secondary ﬁgure from a primary ﬁgure
moving in the vertical direction is identical to the one just described.
The only practical difference is that one should use vertical counters
and vertical-count parameters.

Figure 6-21b is a block diagram of a tagalong system that allows
two-dimensional motion (both horizontal and vertical) for the prim—
ary and secondary ﬁgures. The primary ﬁgure is initialized by setting
the PINTC input to logic 0. When this happens, the horizontal— and
vertical-slipping counters in the primary ﬁgure slipping-counter cir-
cuit are reset by external initialization pulses, HINTP and VINTP.
And if the secondary ﬁgure is also initialized at the time (by setting
SINTC to logic 0), the secondary slipping-counter board is seeing
both horizontal- and vertical-reset pulses from the primary initializa-
tion circuit.

The two slipping-counter boards are thus synchronized, and
the initial position of the primary ﬁgure is determining the position of
the secondary ﬁgure.

Once PIN TC is set to logic 1, the primary slipping counter
begins taking reset pulses from its own reset-pulse system,_ causing
the primary ﬁgure to begin moving in directions and at speeds
determined by the VC and HC inputs to the primary ﬁgure slipping-
counter board. Since SINTC is still at logic 0, the secondary ﬁgure
slipping counter is still taking reset pulses from the primary circuit.
The secondary ﬁgure is thus locked to the primary ﬁgure, following it
wherever it goes.

Whenever SINTC is set to logic 1, the secondary ﬁgure slipping
counter is ﬁnally released from the primary circuit. The secondary
