You can actually build any of your favorite complex ﬁgures and
move them vertically on the screen by simply substituting VM
connections for the V-count speciﬁcations you speciﬁed for static
complex ﬁgures.

Of course you can introduce some “intertia” into the vertical
motion by modifying the timer circuit to work like that shown in Fig.
5-6.

The basic vertical-motion control circuit in Fig. 5-7 will play a
vital role in all the table tennis games described later in this book.

The circuit for generating complex ﬁgures that are manually
adjustable in the horizontal directions is practically identical to the
vertical-motion circuit. The basic idea, in fact, is exactly the same.

As shown in Fig. 5-9a, a monostable multivibrator is triggered
by the HRST signal, a pulse that occurs at the end of each horizontal
scan. And although the horizontal-motion counters (IC’s 5, 6, and
8A) receive HCLK pulses continuously, the timer holds the HM
count at zero until the HTIME output of ICZ-B drops to zero. At that
moment, the HM counters begin running, generating a delayed
version of the standard horizontal-count signals.

You can build any of the complex-ﬁgure generators described in
Chapter 4, then attach it to this horizontal—motion control circuit as
shown in the block diagram in Fig. 5-9b. Note that all of the
horizontal-count speciﬁcations come from the horizontal-motion
counters, while the vertical-count speciﬁcations come from the
Sourcebox.

The player can adjust or move the complex ﬁgure back and forth
across the screen by means of the HORIZONTAL POSITION
control, R3. As in the case of the verﬁcal-motion-control circuit, the
range of horizontal motion can be modiﬁed by selecting alternate
values of R4 and C4.

Figure 5-10 shows the block diagram and basic matrix speciﬁca-
tions for generating a racing-car ﬁgure. The car in this instance is
movable in the horizontal directions. You can use the same general
scheme, however, to generate a horizontally movable version of any
complex ﬁgure you choose.

Figure 5-11 is a complete schematic diagram for the movable
racing car, including the matrix-generating circuit. This particular
circuit will be used later in this chapter for making a popular racing
game.

Using the pin numbers designated in parentheses, this circuit
can be permanently mounted to a plug-in card (Radio Shack 276-153)
and plugged into the receptacle on the Sourcebox Unit.
