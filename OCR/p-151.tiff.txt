the screen when the wiper arm of R7 is to COMM, and it should
move to the extreme right-hand side when the wiper arm of R7 is to
+5V.

Once you have set the position of R1 to your satisfaction, don’t
move it again. Remove the jumper from R7 and position the line on
the screen by means of that control.

With this preliminary alignment job out of the way, insert
capacitors C7 and C8 as shown in Fig. 5-6. As you adjust R7 now,
you will ﬁnd that the line responds as through it has some “slop” or
inertia. The line’s response, in other words, is not immediately
coupled to changes at the position control.

While the values of “inertia” resistors R8 and R9 are critical to
the alignment of the timer, the values of C7 and C8 are not. You can
change the values of those capacitors to get the amount of inertia you
want. The larger the values of C7 and C8, the more inertia the line
seems to have.

The vertical positioning circuits can be modiﬁed in a similar
fashion, triggering with VRST and changing the value of C2 from 100
13F to 0.047 p.F. The initial alignment procedure is the same one
already described for the “sloppy” horizontal position control circuit.

MANUAL CONTROL OF COMPLEX FIGURES

The material in this section describes one technique for moving
complex ﬁgures to any desired point on the screen. This technique is
an extension of the rectangle-motion scheme already discussed in
this chapter. But rather than using a monostable multivibrator to
generate the object itself, the monostable effectively “tells" a
counter when to begin counting or when to reset to zero. The
timer-controlled counter then provides select and windowing infor-
mation for a matrix generator—any of the complex ﬁgure matrix
generators in Chapter 4.

Figure 5-7 shOWS a simpliﬁed block diagram and a complete
schematic for a circuit that lets the player move any complex ﬁgure in
a vertical direction.

Monostable multivibrator ICZ-A is triggered on each time a
VRST pulse appears at its TRIG input. Or to put it in the context of
the TV raster, this timer begins timing each time the raster reaches
the bottom of the screen.

The timer's output remains at logic 1 through the vertical-
blanking interval and into some portion of the vertical—scanning
interval determined by the values of C2, R2, and R1. A very similar
timing circuit in Fig. 5-2 generates a horizontal line that can be
