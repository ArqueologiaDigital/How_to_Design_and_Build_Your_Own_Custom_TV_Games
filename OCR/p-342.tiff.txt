The ball, in other words, travels for a longer period of time off
the green than it does when it is on the green. R12 can be adjusted to
give a gooisgeed difference between a drive and putt swing.

The RST input to ICS—B is responsible for locking out the
ball-travel timer whenever the ball touches the hole. The ball cannot
be moved once it is in the hole. It can be released only by depressing
the TEE switch, an action which reinitializes the system at a new
point determined by the program counter.

The A/ D converter circuitry occupying most of this logic board
in Fig. 8-18 is simply that required for controlling the speed of the
ball from potentiometers. The circuit is taken directly from the
discussion surrounding Fig. 7-12. The HCONT and VCONT inputs
come directly from the potentiometers (or joystick) on the control
panel.

The horizontal portion of the A/D speed control is built mainly
around IC4~A and counter IC7. While the speed is actually controlled
by the RIGHT/ LEFT control on the player’s panel, trimmer resistor
R2 is used for calibrating the speed. To adjust this HTRIM control,
set the RIGHT/ LEFT potentiometer on the control panel for
maximum right speed, then trim HTRIM for the desired maximum
right speed. Then set the RIGHT/LEFT control to the opposite
extreme and readjust HTRIM for good left motion.

Continue working the RIGHT/ LEFT control between its two
extremes, adjusting HTRIM as necessary to get smooth right-and—
left control from the panel.

Work through the same set of adjustments for the UP/ DOWN
control on the panel, using VTRIM to calibrate the two extremes. It

is IC4-B, you see, that works with counter IC8 to produce vertical—
ball-motion codes.

The outputs of the A/D converter section are 1PHC through
SPHC (horizontal speed and direction codes) and 1PVC through
8PVC (vertical speed and direction codes).

The circuit in Fig. 8-19 is called the Figure Board on the wiring
block diagram. This board includes circuitry for converting the
output of the program counter into position information for the hole
and green, detecting contact between the ball and green or ball and
hole, and changing the color of the ball from white to black as it
moves onto the green.

The size and position of the green is determined by comparator
Circuits IC7 and 1C9, where IC7 determines the horizontal compo-
nent and ICQ ﬁxes the vertical component. These two ICs compare
board inputs CA through CD with horizontal— and vertical-count
