initializing circuit. Without this power-on feature, the player might
ﬁnd he cannot initiate the game as soon as power is applied to the
circuit. The ﬂip-ﬂop, in other words, might take on an initial state
whereby the game is enabled and the START switch is locked out.
This leads to the awkward possibility of never being able to get the
game started. Of course different kinds of games present different
start-up conditions, depending on the nature of the game, itself.

The little circuit in Fig. 6-6b shows a power-on reset circuit that
can be inserted between the output of the time delay circuit and the
STOP input of the RS ﬂip-ﬂop. When power is ﬁrst applied to the
game, the 0. Ol-ptF capacitor pulls the input of an inverter to logic 0
for several microseconds. The inverter’s output thus rises to logic 1
for that interval, guaranteeing a logic-0 output from the NOR gate.
This pulse is then inverted again and applied to the STOP input of the
R-S ﬂip-ﬂop. Any reset pulses to that ﬂip-ﬂop come only from the
delay circuit, once the system has been initialized after tum-on.

The most important reason for working out a preliminary draw-
ing, however, is to give the designer an opportunity to optimize the
number of IC chips required. As shown in the preliminary drawing in
Fig. 6—6a, the circuit requires a total of 6 ICs: one package each of
Z-input N ORs, 2-input NANDs, 4-input NANDs and inverters, and
two packages of 556 dual timers. Using so many different kinds of IC
logic packages, however, leaves plenty of spares. See the table in
Fig. 6-6.

Note that the circuit calls for only three inverters, and that
there are three NAN D gates left over. Why not replace the inverters
with NAND-gate versions of them. That eliminates one package of
inverters and makes more efﬁcient use of the NAN D gates already
available.

Then, too, it is quite likely the game circuit will contain a spare
4-input NAN D gate. That kind of gate at the input of the auto-stop
circuit can be eliminated from the control circuit, leaving the job to be
done on the game board, itself. That eliminates another IC package
from the control circuit.

Now the circuit requires only four IC packages. The ﬁnal step in
the design procedure is to redraw the schematic, incorporating the
modiﬁcations just described. The ﬁnal circuit appears in Fig. 6-7.

After studying the ﬂow diagram, block diagram, and preliminary
schematic, you should have no trouble understanding the operation
of the control circuit in Fig. 6-7. R8 and C6 make up the power-on
initializing circuit, ensuring the START switch is enabled the mo-
ment power is ﬁrst applied. Depressing the START switch then
enables the game. And whenever the RESET input indicates a
