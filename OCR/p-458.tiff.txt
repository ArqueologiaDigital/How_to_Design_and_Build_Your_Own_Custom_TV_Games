enced technicians, but a beginner will ﬁnd the task a rather trouble-
some one at times.

What is the result of all this analysis and simpliﬁcation? The
answer is contained in the fairly simple circuit in Fig. 11-4. Here we
have the complete circuit for generating the 4-frame animated se-
quence in Fig. 11-2, and also a prime example of how it is possible to
devise some simple circuitry for carrying out what appears at ﬁrst to
be an exceedingly difﬁcult task. In this particular example, a 4-frame
animated sequence is simpliﬁed to a point where it can be im-
plemented with an 8 X 8 extended matrix generator and only four
outboard IC devices.

Comparing the tables in Fig. 11-3 with the circuit in Fig. 11—4, it
can be seen that the data inputs requiring a logic 0 in all cases can be
connected together to COMM, while those calling for a constant
logic-l level can be connected together at +5V. These two simple
operations take care of 18 of the D inputs for both frames.

Furthermore, the D10 input is always equal to X and D19 is at
the Xlevel. The X input in Fig. 11—4 is thus connected directly to
D10, while D19 sees a version of the same input that is ﬁrst inverted
by IC3-B. . ’

All that remains as far as the D inputs are concerned are those
designated D1, D2, D7, and D25 in Fig. 11-3c. This set of inputs
differs from the others inasmuch as they vary according to the frame
being displayed. Input D1, for instance, is equal to X during frame 1
(B0=0), but must be set at logic 0 through frame 2 (B021).

The BO signal—the one distinguishing data for frame 1 from
that of frame 2—is generated by the least-signiﬁcant output of a 2-bit
binary counter, ICZ-A and ICZ-B. Whenever B0 is equal to 0, IC3-A
is effectively gate on, and an inverted version of the X signal from
IC3-B is presented to D1. D1, in other words, is set to X whenever
3020 (a condition that satisﬁes the requirements established for D1
in Fig. 11—3c). Whenever BO switches to logic 1, however, it gates
off IC3—A and guarantees a logic-0 level at D1. _

The data for D2 is derived in a similar fashion, taking its Xdata
from IC3-B and frame-select data from the 1?) output of ICZ—A.
When 8020, then, B0 is equal to logic 1, and ICS is effectively gated
off to feed a guaranteed logic-0 level to D2. Whenever B0 switches
to logic 1, however, 13—0 is set to logic 0, and D2 sees an X signal.
These conditions meet the requirements spelled out for D2 in Fig.
11-3c.

According to Fig. 11-3c, D25 is simply an inverted version of
the D2 input. That is, D25=1 when D220, and D25=X when
D2=X. All that is necessary for generating the D25 input, then, is an
