Programmable
Position and Motion Controls

 

It is possible to realize some overall savings of time and money by
using programmable ﬁgure—generating and motion-control circuits.
The initial investment is larger because programmable circuits are
generally more complicated than those designed for specific game
applications. Being able to use the same circuitry for a number of
different video game formats, however, soon lets the circuit pay for
itself a number of times over.

The circuits described here are close cousins of the fully pro-
grammable TV game computer systems on the market today. The
experimenter isn’t bound to a set of ﬁxed game formats; yet, the
scheme goes a long way toward simplifying game design procedures
and reducing the amount of new hardware for each game. It also
turns out that these little programmable circuits can do some things
that are terribly difﬁcult to do with the motion-control circuits de-
scribed thus far.

The digital device at the heart of this programmable-ﬁgure
scheme is the 7485 4-bit magnitude comparator shown in Fig. 8-1.
Basically, the circuit accepts two 4-bit binary words or numbers,
compares their magnitudes, and generates an output specifying
whether one is equal, greater or less than the other.

One of the two input numbers is designated number A, and is
composed of bits A0 through A3, with A0 being the least-signiﬁcant
bit. The second input number is designated number B, and is com-
posed of bits B0 through BB, with B3, with B0 being the least-
significant bit.
