timer, it can be reset anytime a new bad guy appears, whether the
old one managed to live 5 seconds or not. If a bad guy can survive
through the normal timing interval of IC8-B, a pulse generator
composed of IC2-C and ICZ-D creates a brief negative-going pulse
that ultimately resets the monostable action once again.

The LOAD output in Fig. 8-25 is normally at logic 0, rising to
logic 1 only long enough to call up a new bad-guy ﬁgure. The
remainder of the Ambush circuitry is shown on the Ambush-ﬁgure
board in Fig. 8-26.

The special feature of the Ambush game is its ability to generate
bad-guy ﬁgures at random positions on the left-hand side of the
screen. 1C4 and 1C5 in Fig. 8-26 make up a pair of programmable
position controls. IC4 is responsible for ﬁxing the vertical compo—
nent and 1C5 sets the horizontal component of the bad-guy ﬁgure. It
is the 4-bit logic levels from IC6, however, that determine the bad
guy’s position.

IC6 is a 4-bit latch, or memory, circuit. The data input in this
case comes from the 1V, 2V, 4V, and 8V connections of the Source-
box. This 4-bit data is loaded into the latch only when the LOAD
input to pins 4 and 13 is at a logic-1 level. This loading condition
occurs only for a brief interval when the control board operations call
for seeing a new bad-guy ﬁgure. Once the data is loaded, it is held at
the outputs of IC6 until the control system calls for a new bad-guy
ﬁgure.

Since the data inputs to IC6 come from a counter system that is
running continuously, and since the LOAD pulse occurs at some
time that is determined by the game action, it follows that the data
loaded into IC6 is virtually random in nature. In essence, IC6 works
as a random-number generator.

Accepting the notion that 106 is a random-number generator, it
should become apparent that the horizontal- and vertical-
programming data to 1C5 and 1C4 occurs in a random sequence. The
bad-guy ﬁgure thus appears on the screen at some position deter-
mined strictly by the random number from IC6 and the wiring
between IC6 and the program inputs of 1C4 and 1C5.

The horizontal and vertical components from 1C4 and 1C5 are
NANDed together in ICl-A to create a bad-guy ﬁgure that measures
16V>< 16H. This image is passed through IC2-A, where it can be
ﬂashed whenever the good guy scores a hit. The horizontal and
vertical components of the good-guy ﬁgure are combined in IC2-C.
And after that, the two ﬁgures are effectively ORed together by
IC2-B and ICl-B to create the game’s video output.
