- If a cell in the top half of the matrix and its extended
counterpart in the bottom half are to be black, connect that
position on the multiplexer’s D inputs to logic 0.

- If a cell in the top half of the matrix is to be black and its
extended counterpart in the bottom half of the matrix is to
be white, connect a noninverted 64V source to the approp—
riate D input on the multiplexer.

o If a cell in the top half of the matrix is to be white and its
extended counterpart in the bottom half of the matrix is to
be black, connect an inverted 64V source to the appropriate
D input on the multiplexer.

This set of rules for designing static figures with the
extended-matrix scheme might seem very complicated at ﬁrst, but it
can become rather obvious after playing with the circuits for a while.

Figure 4-9 shows the matrix pattern, select, window, and
D-input speciﬁcations for generating a stylized S ﬁgure. Note that
the speciﬁcations for the D inputs follow the general rules outlined
above. Cells D0 and DOE, for example, are both white, so there is no
need to make any connection to the DO input of the multiplexer.
Locations D9 and D9E, on the other hand, are both black, so the D9
input on the multiplexer is connected to logic 1.

Cell positions D13 and D13E have opposite colors: D13 is black
and its extended counterpart, D13E, is white; so a noninverted 64V
signal is applied to the D13 input of the multiplexer. And ﬁnally, D4
and D4E are to be white and black respectively, so an inverted 64V
signal is fed to the D4 connection on the multiplexer.

The two ﬁgures in Fig. 4-10 are examples of some 4 x8
extended-matrix designs you might like to try. The question-mark
ﬁgure is especially fun to see on the screen. You might want to use it
as a rather novel response to some sort of questionable move in a TV
game later on.

After studying and applying this extended-matrix technique for
a while, you will ﬁnd it rather easy to design ﬁgures of your own. Just
copy the matrix pattern in Fig. 4—8 and blacken the appropriate cells
with a pencil. Of course you don’t have to use the same select and
window speciﬁcations shown in the examples here, but if you decide
to change them, bear in mind that the matrix cannot be any larger
than the one speciﬁed in these examples. Try it. You’ll ﬁnd it too tall
to ﬁt on the screen. So it is possible to make the matrix much smaller
by reducing the horizontal- and vertical-count speciﬁcations. Then,
too, you can shift the position of the matrix by changing the window
speciﬁcations.
