stances can represent a score for the defensive player because they
lead to a destruction of the attack craft.

A defense torpedo that has been ﬁred is reset under either of
two conditions: AC=DT or DT=TOP. In the ﬁrst case, the defen-
sive player has successfully stopped an attack by hitting the attack
craft with a torpedo. If a defense torpedo misses its target, how—
ever, it continues its steady upward motion until it reaches the top of
the screen as deﬁned by DT=TOP LOGIC. The TOP in this case is
determined by VBLANK and a TOP PULSE GENERATOR.

The four ﬁgures to be displayed (the target, attack craft, attack
torpedo, and defense torpedo) are combined in the GAME VID
OUTPUT LOGIC block to yield a composite game—video signal.

Torpedo Attack Schematics

The complete Torpedo Attack game system requires three
circuit boards for the tagalong feature, three special game—control
boards, and two player-control panels. As described earlier in this
section, the tagalong feature is made up of a pair of identical
slipping-counter boards (Fig. 5-15) and a tagalong—control board
(Fig. 7-13). Figure 7-14 shows the complete wiring detail for these
three tagalong boards.

' The three special control boards for Torpedo Attack are shown
in schematic form in Figs. 7-16, 7 -17, and 7-18. The control panels
are described in connection with the schematics and layouts in Fig.
7-11.

The wiring block diagram in Fig. 7-19 shows the wiring detail
between the tagalong assembly, the three special control boards,
and the control panels.

The circuit board in Fig. 7-16 contains all the components for
the DT (defense torpedo) ﬁgures. The defense player’s four ﬁring
buttons are connected to inputs 81 through S4. These inputs are
normally pulled up to logic 1 by the four 2.2-k0. resistors connected
to +5V. Whenever the defense player depresses one of his four
ﬁring buttons, the logic level at the corresponding S input to the DT
control board is forced to logic 0.

IC4-A in Fig. 7 -16 functions as an OR gate when used with this
active-low input format. Its main job is to sense the fact that the
defense player has depressed any one of the four ﬁring buttons.

Depressing any one of the four DT ﬁring buttons thus causes
IC4—A to generate a positive-going logic level which is then inverted
to a negative-going level by inverter IC5-C. This negative-going
logic level is then transformed into a brief negative-going pulse by
