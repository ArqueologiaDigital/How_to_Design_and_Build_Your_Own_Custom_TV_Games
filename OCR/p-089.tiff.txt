figures use a 4 x 4 format.

soon as the experiments seem to be getting a bit dull, move on to the
next stage of the project, generating extended matrices.

Extending the Matrix

After experimenting with the basic 4 x4 matrix for a while, you
will come to the conclusion that it is incapable of generating a very
wide selection of interesting ﬁgures. The versatility, resolution, and
overall quality of TV-game images is directly proportional to the
