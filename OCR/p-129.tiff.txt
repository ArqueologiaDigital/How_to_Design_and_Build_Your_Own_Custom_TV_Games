described in Chapter 3, but make certain they deliver a black-on-
white signal to the CE input of your multiplexer in the complex-ﬁgure
generator.

Let’s look at that last statement a little closer. The multgilexer
(complex—ﬁgure generator) is windowed ON whenever its CE input
is pulled down to logic 0. This principle has been used in all of the
examples thus far in this chapter. The multiplexer is thus enabled
whenever the windowing circuit generates a logic 0. Or in other
words, the complex ﬁgure will appear on the screen any time the
windowing circuit shows a black bar or rectangle.

Of course the windowing black bar or rectangle must have a size
equal to or greater than that of the ﬁgure it is controlling. Making the
windows too small cuts off part of the ﬁgure, while making the
windows too large allows two or more of the ﬁgures to appear
hooked together. (The latter condition might be something of an
advantage in certain instances, however).

You ought to be anxious to experiment with this idea now; so
start by building the matrix generator circuit in Fig. 4-5, making no
