Fig. 3-11. A basic R-S flip—ﬂop circuit and relevant waveforms.

ICZ-A deﬁnes the starting point of the bar. Viewed on the TV
screen, the output of this NAND gate appears as a relatively narrow
black bar just left of the center of the screen. ICZ-A thus deﬁnes the
starting point of the white bar being generated in this example.

IC2-B in Fig. 3-12 generates the end—of-bar signal. Looking at
the output of this NAN D gate on the screen, it appears as a relatively
narrow black bar just right of the center of the screen. Combining
these two black-bar signals in the R—S ﬂip-ﬂop ICs 4-A and 4-B,
yields the ﬁnal reﬁllt.

The same R-S technique can be applied to the task of generating
broad vertical bars. The only real difference is that the inputs to the
ﬁrst set of NAND gates come from vertical-count sources rather
than horizontal-count sources.

Try building some broad white bars, both horizontal and vertical

ones, until you are conﬁdent you can handle the R-S ﬂip-ﬂop proce-
dure.
