The circuit then selects the 2x vector-multiplier function
Whenever BT=1 and BG=O. Interpreting this in terms of game
operations, that means the ball is in ﬂight, but has not yet touched
the green. The ball travels in a direction, but at twice the speed,
dictated by the outputs of the A/D converter.

The selector circuit then takes its data directly from the A/D
converter whenever BT=1 and BG=1. This status occurs
whenever the ball is moving and touching the green. The overall
effect is that it travels in the same direction, but at half the speed, it
has during free ﬂight off the green.

Golf Wiring Block Diagram

Figure 8-22 shows the wiring block diagram for this particular
Golf game. The system requires four circuit boards of the type
speciﬁed throughout this book (Radio Shack’s 276— 153 40— —pin plug-in
boards).

The power-supply loading can be balanced reasonably well by
operating the slipping-counter board from one supply and the three
remaining boards and control panel from another l-A supply.

The obstacle inputs are not shown here because they should be
left unconnected for this version of golf. A later chapter will show
how to use these RHC and RVC connections on the control board.

AMBUSH

Ambush is a one-player game that takes advantage of position
programming in a rather unique way. The game is a variation of the
old arcade game where the player is supposed to shoot at bad guys
