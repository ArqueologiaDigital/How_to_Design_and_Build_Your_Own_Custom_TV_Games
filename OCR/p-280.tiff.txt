the pulse generator, mad_e up of ICl-A and ICS—A. That particular
pulse sets the status of a R-Sf lip-ﬂop (lCZ-A and ICZ-B) to its ﬁring
mode—one where pin 3 of ICZ-A is set to logic 1 and pin 6 goes to
logic 0.

Putting this all together, depressing any one of the DT ﬁring
switches ultimately sets the DT system to its ﬁring mode, and a DT
ﬁgure is launched. _ _

The DT system is reset to its initial condition whenever the R-S
ﬂip-ﬂop receives a negative-going DTRST pulse at pin 5 of IC2-B;

The output of the ﬁ-gfﬁp-ﬂop controls the operation of a ﬁgure
initialization circuit made up of ICZ—C, ICZ-D, and IC3—A. This part of
the circuit is in the initialization mode wheneveg a DT ﬁgures is not in
ﬂight. In this instance, pin 6 of IC2-B in the RS flip-ﬂop is at logic 1,
thus allowing an inverted version of VRST to pass through ICZ-D
and IC3—A to the loading or reset inputs of a pair of vertical-slipping
counters, 1C8 and ICQ. This forces the vertical positon of all DT
ﬁgures to the bottom of the screen.

Whenever a DT ﬁgure is ﬁred, the initialization circuit is
switched to a condition whereby the slipping counters are loaded
with reset pulses from IC3-B. Under this particular set of conditions,
the slipping counters let the DT ﬁgure move up the screen at a rate
determined by the hard-wired logic levels at preset inputs (pins 15,
1, 10, and 9) of the two slipping counters.

The DT circuitry described to this point merely determined
whether or not a DT ﬁgure is ﬁred and how fast it moves up the
screen. The next part of the problem is to see how one of the four
possible DT ﬁgures is selected.

The DT ﬁgure selection circuitry is built around the four EXC—
LUSIVE OR gates in 1C6, the three NAND gates that feed them,
and the 4-input NAND gate at their outputs.

To see how this ﬁgure-selection scheme works, suppose the
defensive player depressed the FIRE 1 pushbutton. This action pulls
the logic level of 81 input down to logic 0, causing a logic-1 level to
appear at the output of IC4-A as described previously. The output of
this gate is returned to pins 4 and 13 of ICIO, the gate inputs of a 4-bit
data latch. The pattern of logic levels present at the S inputs is thus
latched in IC10, and remains ﬁxed at the outputs of IClO even after
the player releases the ﬁring button. ,

In this particular example described here, the defensive player
has depressed the FIRE 1 button on his control panel, so the 4-bit
latch is loaded with a logic 0 at pin 9 of IClO and logic ls at the three
. remaining outputs.
