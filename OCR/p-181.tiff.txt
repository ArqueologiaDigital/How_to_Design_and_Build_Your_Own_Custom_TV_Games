Some Useful Game Control Schemes

 

Automatic motion is indeed the hallmark of video games, but au—
tomatic game sequencing runs a close second. Most TV games
employ automatic start-up and stop features, for example. Then
there are other kinds of events and sequences of events that occur
during a game, some manually controlled and others automatic.

Consider the control schemes for a basic table tennis game.
The game sequence is usually initiated manually by depressing a
RESTART pushbutton, but it generally ends automatically as one
player reaches a certain score. In some instances, the ball-serving
sequence is initiated manually, while in other versions of the same
game, the ball is served manually. But in either case, the serving
sequence is terminated automatically as one player misses the ball.
These operations are examples of game control schemes.

Study the circuits in this chapter carefully. A proper under-
standing of them will make it easier for you to understand the control
features of sample games presented later in this book, and it will
certainly make the process of designing your own games more fun,
easier, and more efﬁcient.

GAME START/RESET CONTROLS

Most TV games begin with some kind of initial action some-
where on the screen, and by the same token, most games include a
critical point where the system is to be reset to begin another cycle
of one game or begin a new game altogether.
