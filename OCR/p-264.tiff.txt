The timing interval of the monostable multivibrator is deter-
mined by the values of R2, R3, and C3. Normally the controls are
adjusted so that the count reaches any number between 5 and 15,
the normal operating range for the binary numbers fed to the speed
and direction control inputs of the slipping counters.

So let’s suppose the player wants to stop the motion of a ﬁgure
on the screen. All he has to do is adjust the value of R2 so that the
counter increments to the binary equivalent of 9 (_the_stop code)
during the monostable’s timing interval. When the 128P pulse oc-
curs, then, the counter is cleared to zero, then allowed to count at
the 2V rate until the timing interval is over. To stop the motion of the
ﬁgure, the counting interval should be terminated with the counter
showing an output of 1001 (decimal 9).

The counter then holds that number until 138—? occurs once
again. And if the player has not changed the position of the control,
the counter repeats its count—to—9 sequence.

If the player then wants to move the ﬁgure to the right at a
relatively high speed, he adjusts the control so that the monostable’s
output timing is a bit shorter, short enough to stop the counting
operation at a number such as 0101 (decimal 5).

If, on the other hand, the player wants to move the ﬁgure to the
left, he adjusts R2 for a slightly longer timing interval from 1C3,
letting the counter run to perhaps 1101 (decimal 13).

Recall that the horizontal-slipping counter samples its speed
and direction codes during the vertical-blanking interval. This circuit
has its 4-bit output established before vertical blanking occurs, and it
holds that number through blanking and, in fact, all the way to the
end of WV.

The vertical-slipping counter samples its 4-bit control input
continuously. And since the output of 1C4 in Fig. 7-12 spends some
of its time counting, it yields some undesirable and confusing
vertical-motion effects on the screen. It is thus necessary to load the
output of 1C4 into a temporary memory circuit when it is being used
in conjunction with a vertical-slipping-counter circuit. 1C5 shown in
the insert in Fig. 7-12 is a quad D latch that performs this function.

The outputs of 1C4 are connected to the corresponding inputs
of ICS for vertical-motion control. The latch is normally in its mem-
ory mode, keeping the four VC outputs stable through the counter’s
up-counting functions. The count output is then updated whenever
the VRST pulse occurs.

The TRIM potentiometer in Fig. 7—12 is used for adjusting the
control range of the main control potentiometer. First set the main
