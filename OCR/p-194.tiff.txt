condition in the game that calls for resetting the system, it initiates
the 5-second delay interval at ICZ-A. After that interval is over,
ICZ-B generates a pulse that ultimately triggers pin 6 of IC3-B to
disable the game and unlock the START switch circuit.

It would be a good idea to dream up a few control systems of
your own, following the procedures outlined here. This same proce-
dure, in a somewhat more elaborate form, is quite necessary for
planning entire game systems. Get the procedure clear in your mind
now, and you'll ﬁnd you have a powerful design tool at your disposal
later on.
