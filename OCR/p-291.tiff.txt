secondary ﬁgure then leaves the primary ﬁgure, taking on a speed
and direction that is dictated by the set of control data present the
moment the missile is ﬁred. In the case of the Missile and Torpedo
Attack games described earlier in this chapter, the missile leaves the
primary ﬁgure with the same speed and direction the primary ﬁgure
had at the moment of launching. In this case, however, the missile
leaves in the same direction, but at a faster speed. And that means
the secondary—ﬁgure controls must be loaded with speed and direc-
tion data that is entirely different from that of its primary ﬁgure.

Figure 7-22 shows a complete analysis of control data that is
entered into any of the slipping-counter schemes described thus far.
There are two relevant mathematical equations that show how fast a
ﬁgure moves across the screen and, alternately, how long it takes to
move across the screen.

The velocity (v) is expressed in rather unusual units of screens .
per second. It is possible to use other, more conventional units of
speed, such as inches per second, but such units vary with the size of
the experimenter’s TV screen. The screens-per-second unit of
speed on the screen.

The velocity of a ﬁgure, in either the horizontal or vertical
direction, is determined by the ﬁrst equation in Fig. 7-22. Note that
