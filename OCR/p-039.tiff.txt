Chapter 3
Building Static Figures

 

For the purposes of this book, static ﬁgures are considered any
ﬁgures, no matter how simple or complex, that do not move on the
screen. Such ﬁgures, in the context of TV games, can represent
game boundaries, obstacles and nonmoving targets.

A static ﬁgure, incidentally, does not have to be a visible one.
Invisible ﬁgures can add an extra bit of challenge to an otherwise
too-simple game; but more importantly, invisible lines and rectan-
gles can serve as “windows” for conﬁning other images to a ﬁeld that
is smaller than the TV screen.

Static ﬁgures, whether visible or not, play invaluable roles in
TV-games technology; and it turns out that building static ﬁgures can
be a fascinating and rewarding pastime in itself.

This chapter describes a number of basic techniques for build-
ing static lines, bars, and rectangles, while the following chapter
takes up the special subject of building complex static ﬁgures (cir-
cles, ﬁgures with diagonal lines, images of people, rocket ships,
cars, etc.).

Each technique is illustrated with several speciﬁc examples,
and the reader will ﬁnd the procedures used many times and in many
different ways throughout the book. It is important to bear in mind,
however, that the purpose of this book is to provide some guidelines
for creating original TV games and displays. For that reason, alone,
it is just as important to understand the essence of each ﬁgure-
building technique as it is to see how the speciﬁc examples work.
