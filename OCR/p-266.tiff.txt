control to one extreme position, then adjust R3 for the desired
maximum speed in that direction. Then set R2 to its opposite
extreme and adjust R3 again for the desired maximum speed. Work
R2 back and forth between its extremes, gradually adjusting the
trirnpot for the most useful control range.

The main control, R2, is normally mounted externally on a
separate control panel. The trimpot, however, is mounted to the
circuit board.

Figure 7-13 includes a pair of these motion-control circuits: one
for the horizontal and another for the vertical motion of the attack
craft. Note that the t_vgg_monostable multivibrators, ICl-A and
IC1—B, share the same 128P inputs,and that R1 controls the horizon-
tal component of motion and R3 controls the vertical component.
Also note that the vertical-speed counter (1C4) is followed by the
latch circuit, 1C5.

This potentiometer-controlled motion interface circuit is an
integral part of the attack craft control in the Torpedo Attack game.
It will also be used a number of times in other game systems through
the remainder of this book.

A Complete Tagalong Motion Control System

The attack craft in this game is to carry along an attack torpedo
until the aggressor launches it, presumably toward the target image.
Chapter 6 includes a general description of the tagalong process, but
now it is time to look at one such system in much greater detail.

The schematic diagram in Fig. 7-13 shows the tagalong-control
portion of the system. Eventually we will show that this circuit
interfaces with a pair of slipping-counter-control boards, one for the
primary ﬁgure (the attack craft) and another for the secondary ﬁgure
(the attack torpedo). See the slipping-counter schematic in Fig.
5-15.

Most of the circuitry in Fig. 7-13 is simply a pair of
potentiometer-controlled elements that generate binary speed and,
direction codes. ICI—A and 1C3, of instance, translate the setting of
R1 into a 4—bit binary number representing the speed and direction of
a ﬁgure in the horizontal plane. IC1-B, 1C4, and 1C5 do the same sort
of job for motion in the vertical directions.

N ow bear in mind that this circuit controls two separate
slipping-counter boards. All of the input and output designations that
include a P character indicate signals to or from the primary-ﬁgure
slipping counter, while those including an S character indicate signals
concerned with the secondary ﬁgure.
