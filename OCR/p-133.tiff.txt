for TV games, many other games call for patterns of identical ﬁgures
that are not in regular rows and columns. It is often more desirable to
create irregular, or even random, patterns of identical ﬁgures,
something that cannot be done with the bar-and—rectangle window-
ing approach.

It is possible to generate a complex pattern of complex, but
identical, ﬁgures by windowing a ﬁgure-generating multiplexer cir-
cuit with yet another multiplexer circuit. In other words, the window
generator is, itself, a complex ﬁgure generator.

Figure 4-35 illustrates this particular approach to generating
some complex patterns. IC5 and IC6 are both 16:1 multiplexer
circuits. IC6 generates the basic complex ﬁgure as described in the
ﬁrst sections of this chapter. The inputs to SO through 83 determine
the dimensions of the complex ﬁgure, While information at the D
inputs determine what the ﬁgure will be.

IC5 is a similar kind of circuit that generates a matrix of its own.
The dimensions of this pattern matrix are determined by H- and
V-count signals applied to pattern-select inputs W80 through W83,
while the pattern, itself, is determined by the data applied to the ﬁeld
pattern data inputs W0 through W15.

Electrically speaking, the two multiplexer circuits are Virtually
identical. They play two entirely different roles in the pattern—
generating process, however. IC6 generates the basic ﬁgure, while
IC5 determines where and how many identical ﬁgures appear on the
screen.

To see how this scheme works, program IC6 to generate the
simple X pattern in Fig. 4-3321. As long as there are no connections to
the inputs of IC5 and the pattern window NAND gate, you will see
the basic X pattern repeated all over the screen.

Now connect the pattern select inputs to IC5 as speciﬁed in Fig.
4-35: W80 = 32H, W81 = 64H, W82 = 32V, and W83 = 64V.
There will be no obvious change in the pattern on the screen,
however, until one or more of the W inputs to IC5 is connected to
logic 0. Every time you connect one of those W inputs to logic 0, you
will ﬁnd some of the ﬁgures eliminated from the screen.

IC5, itself, is serving the function of a complex figure
generator. The “ﬁgure” in this instance is the desired pattern of cars
on the screen. A logic 1, or no connection, to a W input allows the
basic ﬁgure to appear at the corresponding matrix location. Setting a
W input to logic 0, on the other hand, eliminates a ﬁgure at the matrix
location. Using inverted or noninverted versions of 128H creates an
extended window matrix. Figure 4-36 shows the speciﬁcations for
