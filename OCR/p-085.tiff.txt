To get a better feeling for what is happening here, make the
connections to the multiplexer as prescribed in Fig. 4-4b. Every one
of the D-input positions that are connected to logic 0 (COMM)
generates a white area on the screen. (Remember that the multip-
lexer inverts the data.) So the image on the screen should corres-
pond to the drawing in Fig. 4-4b.

Certainly there are more than one of these “Block-C” ﬁgures on
the screen. That is a clear indication that the system is generating
the little matrix pattern a number of times for each horizontal and
vertical scan cycle.

If you are beginning to get a grasp of what is going on here, you
should be able to predict what will happen if you connect the D6 input
(pin 2) to logic 0. Try it. That operation should ﬁll in the black area
designated D6 in Fig. 4-4b, converting the white block-C ﬁgure into
