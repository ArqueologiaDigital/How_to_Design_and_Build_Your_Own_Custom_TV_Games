Torpedo Attack Wiring Diagram

Figure 7-19 shows a recommended wiring diagram for this
particular game. The tagalong system shown in this diagram is
actually a composite of the three circuit boards and interconnections
detailed previously in Fig. 7-14. Half the circuitry for this game can
thus be used in other games, including the Dogﬁght system de-
scribed in the section that follows.

Using six circuit boards and two control panels pushes the
system’s main power supply a bit beyond maximum capacity. Try
operating one slipping-counter board and the tagalong board from
the Game-A supply, and the second slipping-counter and Figure
Boards (Fig. 7-17) from the Game-B supply. That leaves only the
DT and Logic boards as well as the two control panels that must be
operated from an auxiliary 5-V, l-A supply.

DOGFIGHT

Here is a popular video game adapted for the home experi~
menter. The game requires two players, each controlling the ﬂight
of an aircraft that is capable of ﬁring a missile at the other’s craft. The
players have complete freedom to ﬂy their primary ﬁgure anywhere
on the screen. This particular version has no barriers or borders to
restrict the ﬂight.

The special wrinkle in this game is the circuitry required for
making the missile leave the craft at twice the craft’s speed and in the
same direction. This involves the use of a 2 X vector multiplier circuit
which, at first thought, might seem to be rather complicated, but it
turns out that the circuitry isn’t very complicated at all.

The ﬂow charts in Fig. 7 -20 show the control sequences for this
Dogﬁght game. Since the two charts are identical, a careful study of
one of them automatically leads to a complete understanding of the
other.

Suppose both players are piloting their primary ﬁgures (their
respective “C” figures) around the screen, carrying their missiles in
a tagalong fashion. N ow let Player A trigger his missile. According to
the ﬂow chart on the left-hand side of Fig. 7-20, this action sets the
AM (Player A’s missile) mode. One of two things can happen: that
missile ﬁgure can come into contact with Player B’s craft (AM=BC)
or A’s missile ﬂight time expires (AMT=O). In either case, the
missile is immediately returned to the primary craft (RESET AM)
but if the missile happens to hit the opponent’s craft, the destroyed
craft is ﬂashed for about 1 second.
