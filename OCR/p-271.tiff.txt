logic circuit, which determines the DT ﬁgure to be displayed. The
same ﬁring pulse from the DT launch panel goes to a simple pulse
generator and releases the initialization operation on a vertical-
slipping counter. The vertical component of the selected DT ﬁgure
thus begins moving upward from its initial position at the bottom of
the screen. The rate of motion is internally ﬁxed at a moderately high
speed.

The DT horizontal-position-logic circuit thus determines which
one of the four DTs are ﬁred, while the DT initialization logic and
vertical’slipping counter determine when and how rapidly the DT
ﬁgure moves up the screen. The horizontal and vertical components
of the selected DT ﬁgure are combined in the DT ﬁgure logic block to
form a complete image.

The DT figure continues moving up the screen until a
negative-going DTRST pulse appears at the initialization-logic block.
At that moment, the DT ﬁgure is blanked from the screen and the
whole DT system is re-initialized until the defensive player launches
another one.

The attack craft and attack torpedo block diagram is somewhat
more involved. Note ﬁrst in Fig. 7 -15b that this system includes the
tagalong scheme represented by the tagalong control board, the
primary ﬁgure slipping counter, and the secondary ﬁgure slipping
counter. The video information for the two ﬁgures are taken from
their respective slipping counters and formed into images by the AC
and AT ﬁgure logic blocks.

A pulse generator taking its input from 128V generates both the
13—813 and PVINT pulses required for the tagalong scheme.
Whenever the position of the primary ﬁgure is to be initialized, its
vertical position is thus ﬁxed at the point where the 128V count
makes a transition from O to 1, near the middle of the screen.

The HINTP pulse generator merely ﬁxes the horizontal posi-
tion of the primary ﬁgure whenever it is initialized. In this case, the
ﬁgure is initialized at the end of HBLAN K, or at the left-hand edge of
the screen.

The attack control panel provides horizontal and vertical infor-
mation from a pair of potenitometers or a joystick. These signals
control the motion in the same fashion as R1 and R3 in Fig. 7-13.

The AT ﬂip-ﬂop circuit determines whether the secondary
ﬁgure, the attack torpedo, is synchronized with the primary ﬁgure or
free to move on its own accord. An ATLAUN CH pulse from the
attack-control panel sets this ﬂip-ﬂop to a condition that allows the
attack t_o__rp__e§o to leave the primary ﬁgure. This is accomplished by
setting FIRE to logic 0. The secondary ﬁgure then remains indepen-
