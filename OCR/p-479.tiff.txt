The circuit in Fig. 11-15, derived from the rationale in Fig.
11-14, can be considered a universal 90° rotator for 8 x 8 matrix
ﬁgures. The circuit calls for six 4:1 multiplexers, each feeding the
appropriate data to a select input on the matrix generator. The
circuit satisﬁes the truth table in Fig. 11-15, and that table is based
on the data derived from the basic 8 x 8, 90° shifting requirements
in Fig. 1144.

So much for the basic 8 X 8 90° shifter. Now consider how it
can be combined with an animation sequence to rotate the ﬁgure of a
tank on the screen.

Figure 11-16 shows a tank ﬁgure built within an 8 X 8 extended
matrix. This is a 4-frame animation sequence that can be program-
med at the D inputs of the matrix generator in Fig. 4—17.

Frame 1 shows the tank in its basic 0° position. This is probably
the best tank ﬁgure that can be constructed within an 8 x 8 matrix.
Frame 2 then shows the tank ﬁgure rotated clockwise by 22. 5°. The
image is terribly distorted, but it is the best we can do with a 64-ce11
matrix. And besides, the distortion really doesn’t seem so bad to
players lost in the action of a video game.

Frame 3 then shows the tank ﬁgure rotated to 45°, an additional
22.5° from that in frame 2. The distortion is somewhat less objec-
tionable in this case. _

And ﬁnally, frame 4 shows the same ﬁgure rotated to 67.5°.

The scheme involves a total of four unique animation frames.
There is no way any one of these frames can be derived from another
by performing any sort of shifting operation. It is possible, however,
to generate 12 additional frames by rotating each of them through a
complete sequence of 90° intervals. If frame 1 is rotated 90°, for
instance, the impression is that of a tank ﬁgure pointing to the right.
Another 90° shift on that same frame yields a total of 180°, thereby
making the tank ﬁgure point toward the bottom of the screen. Yet
another 90° shift transforms frame 1 into a tank ﬁgure pointing to the
left (a total of 270° angular shift).

This 90°—shifting sequence can be applied to any one of the four
basic frames, producing a total of 16 tank images, images giving the
impression of a full 360° rotation at 22.5° increments.

Before carrying the discussion of 90° shifting any further, it is
necessary to work out the circuit for generating the four frames in
Fig. 11-16. This is done using the same procedures outlined in the
ﬁrst part of this chapter. The data resulting from this procedure is
summarized in the tables in Fig. 11-17. Figure 11-18 then shows the
appropriate circuitry.
