more of these basrc static ﬁgures must be combined on the screen to
' make up a more useful and interesting game pattern.

Speaking in digital terms, the process of combining two or more
static ﬁgures on the screen is a matter of ORing together the
individual elements. In terms of Tinkerbox technology, this means
running the output of each ﬁgure-generating circuit to a separate
input of a NAND gate. If the output of that NAND gate is then
inverted, the resulting signal is a composite image.

The circuit in Fig. 3-20 shows how four different static ﬁgures
can be combined into a single, composite video waveform. The
procedure takes advantage of De Morgan’s theorem, where a
NAN D gate performs an OR operation if the inputs are in an inverted
form.

Most of the line, bar, and rectangle generators in this chapter
yield inverted signals (black and white) anyway, so the NAND—gate
circuit is the most convenient and efﬁcient one for this particular job.
Note that the output of the NAND gate is an “upright" or white-on-
black signal.

SOME INTERESTING PATTERNS
FROM STATIC-FIGURE COMPONENTS
Figure 3-21 shows a variety of circuits that create some fas-

cinating images on the screen. The basic idea is to combine a certain
horizontal-count input with a vertical-count input of the same order,
64H with 64V, for instance.

- The circuits built around NAND gates produce a regular pattern
of squares on the screen. If the video signal is taken directly from the
output of this NAN D gate, the result is a set of black squares on a
