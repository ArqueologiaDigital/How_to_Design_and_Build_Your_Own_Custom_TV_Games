Whenever you adjust R2 so that the bar moves downward, you
are really setting the oscillator frequency above 60—Hz. The faster
the downward motion, the farther the frequency is above (SO-Hz.

So what you have here is a variable frequency oscillator that has
a middle frequency of about 60-Hz. Varying the frequency either
way from that 60-H2 point causes the figure to move up or down the
screen at a rate determined by the deviation from the basic 60-Hz
rate.

Use the windowing inputs to 1C3 to narrow the bar in the
horizontal direction. With the values shown in Fig. 5—12, you should
be able to see a nice square if you window the bar with 256H, 128H,
and 64H.

The vertical height of the rectangle is determined by the value
of R7. Reducing the value of R7 reduces the height of the rectangle,
and increasing its value increases the height of the rectangle. Unfor-
tunately, any change in the value of R7 causes a change in the
oscillator’s frequency. So whenever you change the value of R7 to
change the height of the rectangle, you must change the value of R6
by a proportional amount, but in the opposite direction.

Play with the values of R7 and R6 to alter the height of the
rectangle and yet maintain complete control over the direction and
speed of vertical motion.

Resistors R1 and R2 ﬁx the range of speed control that is
possible with R2. If these values are too small, you will ﬁnd that the
control is too sensitive, making the rectangle move so fast that it
creates an unintelligible visual impression. Tinker with the values of
R1 and R2 to get the range of speed control that seems most
suitable.

If you would like to indulge in a bit of mathematics, consider the
following equation: 5 = O6-f, where s is the time it takes the re-
ctangle to make an excusion up or down the screen and f is the
frequency of the oscillator. If s is a negative number, it means the
ﬁgure moves downward, but if s is positive, the ﬁgure moves
upward.

What, then, is the oscillator frequency if the ﬁgure is to move
upward and cross the screen in about 1 second? Solving the equation
and substituting +1 for 5 yields 59 Hz. What is the operating
frequency if the rectangle is to move downward across the screen in
1 second? Rearranging the equation to solve for f: f = 60-5; and
substituting —- 1 for 3 yields 1‘ = 60-(— 1) or 61 Hz.

The real reason for indulging in this bit of algebra is to show that
most games require a maximum deviation of 1 Hz around the basic 60
