technology, but they were not. Why not? Because the right kind of
game technology wasn’t available at an affordable cost until recently.

This chapter describes the technologies of TV and TV games,
showing in a very general way how modern TV games are interfaced
with conventional TV receivers. Without at least a basic understand-
ing of the interfacing problems, an experimenter can have little hope
for designing custom TV games. One might be able to duplicate
some of the speciﬁc game circuits shown in this book, but without
that overall View of what-the system is doing, the whole point of
investing money in this book will be lost.

THE TV RASTER

In the simplest terms, the TV raster is that pattern of ﬁne
horizontal lines that can be seen on the screen of a TV receiver. The
set generates these lines whether it is tuned to a station or not. The

horizontal line at a time, beginning near the upper left-hand comer
and progressing toward the lower right-hand corner. Each horizon-
tal line is drawn on the screen from left to right. As the beam reaches
