effect is shown by the D-input speciﬁcations D12 = 128V? and
D15 = 128V-P. This effect is implemented in Fig. 10-9 by ICl-A,
ICl-B, and the three inverters associated with them.

As long as the PADDLE button is not depressed, the PADDLE
input to the ﬁgure board is at logic 1, thereby gating on ICl—A so that
the 128V signal passes through to pin 19 of IC7, the D12 data input.
The same logic level that gates on IC1-A, however, passes through
inverter IC6-C to gate off ICl-B so that pin 16 of IC7 (the D15 input)
sees a logic 0. Depressing the PADDLE button, on the other hand,
sets the MDDLE input to logic 0 to reverse the situation, setting
pin 19 at 0 and pin 16 at 128V. '

The programming for D12 and D15 is thus determined by the
status of the player’s PADDLE pushbutton, altering the horizontal
position of the paddle ﬁgures accordingly.

So much for the D-input programming for IC7. Now the device
is addressed by appropriate combinations of 32H, 64H, 32V, and
64V. Since the circuit is generating a vertically extended matrix, the
V-count addresses go directly to the two higher-order address
locations, pins 13 and 11 of IC7. The ﬁgure is folded in the
horizontal—count direction, however, so the 32H and 64H address
inputs must pass through a pair of EXCLUSIVE OR gates before
applying them to the matrix-generating multiplexer. The foldover
effect makes the horizontal addressing run in the normal up-counting
fashion as long as 128H is low. But when this input goes to logic 1
halfway across the playing area, it reverses the direction of horizon-
tal addressing to create the mirrored left—hand half of the ﬁgure.

The EXCLUSIVE OR gates for creating the foldover effect are
IC5-B and IC5-C. The “gear shift” in this instance is the 256H
connection that is common to both of them.

You might ﬁnd it necessary to study the extension and foldover
effects in greater detail in Chapter 4. Without understanding the
basic principles involved here, there is little hope of understanding
this particular circuit or, more importantly, you will ﬁnd it virtually
impossible to modify the game or design any of your own.

The pinball ﬁgure is not windowed at all in the vertical direction.
It occupies the entire height of the screen. It must be windowed
horizontally, however. And in this case it is windowed by means of
another EXCLUSIVE OR operation on 256H and 128H. These
speciﬁcations put the playing area near the center of the screen,
spanning one complete 128H cycle.

The windowing is implemented in Fig. 10-9 by the EXCLU-
SIVE OR gate, IC5-A . After the output of this gate is inverted by
IC6—D, it is applied to the enabling input of IC7 at pin 9.
