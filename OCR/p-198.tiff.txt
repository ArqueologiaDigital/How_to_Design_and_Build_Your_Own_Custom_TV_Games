images happens to have an active-high (white-on-black) format.
Whenever the Video data for these two images rise to logic 1 at the
same time, the CON output generates negative-going (active-low)
contact pulses at the horizontal-scanning rate.

Whether you should use the circuit in Fig. 6-8a or Fig. 6-8c for
sensing contact between two ﬁgures depends on whether the availa-
ble image information is active low or active high.

The circuit in Fig. 6-8d is simply another example of how
contact-sensing circuits can be applied. In this instance, it is more
efﬁcient to use the NAN D—gate sensing circuit from Fig. 6-8c. Here,
the idea is to sense contact between images A and C or B and C.
Apparently any contact between images A and B is not relevant to
the game.

The video information for images A, B, and C is effectively
ORed at the 3-input NAN D gate, IC5-A. The output of this gate is an
active-high composite game signal.

Images A and B are ORed together at IC3—A, and the resulting
active-high signal is applied to one input of the contact-sensing
circuit, IC3—B. The other input to this contact-sensing gate is an
active-high version of image C. Thus if image A or image B (or both)
come into contact with image C, the output of IC3-B generates
nega_t_i1e:going pulses. When neither A nor B are touching image C,
the CON output rests at logic 1.

The circuits in Figs. 6—8a and 6-8c are “universal” contact-
sensing circuits. Figures 6-8b and 6-8d merely illustrate where the
contact sensors are inserted into the game scheme and, incidentally,
two speciﬁc applications.

Before leaving the subject of contact sensing, why not try
working out a scheme that includes some contact sensing and an
automatically controlled response. The ﬂow chart in Fig. 6-9a repre-
sents a portion of a game where contact between two images causes
one of them to be blanked from the screen. This might be part of a
target game where the player launches a rocket at a moving target. If
the rocket touches the target, the target is blanked from the screen
until some reset action is initiated.

According to the ﬂowchart, the target (image A) is reset so that
it appears on the screen. The play then begins, and continues until
image B touches the target. When the contact occurs, image A is
blanked from the screen. The circles at the top and bottom of the
ﬂow chart imply that these operations are just part of a larger game
and control scheme.

The ﬂow chart is translated into a block diagram in Fig. 6-9b.
The information for image A must pass through a gate before it is
