who feel they are not prepared to design animated ﬁgures would do
well to study the principles outlined in Chapter 4 once again.

FIGURE ANIMATION

The basic idea behind ﬁgure animation (and rotation as well) is
to present a series of ﬁgures on the screen in a fashion that creates
the illusion of motion. The scheme might consist of four different
complex ﬁgures, each differing from the others in some peculiar
way. And when they are ﬂashed onto the screen in a relatively rapid
sequence, the observer gets the impression of motion or animation.

The idea is identical to ﬁlmed animation. In this video situation,
however, the length and complexity of the animated sequence is
necessarily limited by the cost and complexity of the circuitry in-
volved.

So the following discussion presents the basic formula for
generating a simple animated sequence. While the examples are
kept on a rather simple level, the basic scheme can be extended
indeﬁnitely, or at least as far as time, money, and patience can carry
it.

One of the principle IC devices required for generating an
animated sequence is a dual 1-line-to-4-line decoder, 74155. This
particular device has been speciﬁed in earlier game systems, but it is
not important to understand its modes of operation in greater detail.

Figure 11-1 shows the 74155 device, ﬁrst in a functional block
diagram form (Fig. 11-1a), then the pinout (Fig. 11-2b), and ﬁnally in
a truth-table form (Fig. 11-1c).

The device is divided into two separate sections as shown in
Fig. 11-13. As illustrated in the truth tables, any logic level present
at a C input is delivered to one of the four outputs of each section,
depending on the status of select inputs A and B.

Suppose, for example, A=0 and B21. This select status
selects output Y2 for both sections, delivering an inverted version of
C1 to output 1Y2 and a noninverted version to output 2Y2. A given C
input can appear at one, and only one, of its respective Y outputs.

Setting one of the G inputs to logic 1 effectively turns off the
device, causing all Y outputs for that section to take on a logic-1
condition, regardless of the status of the C input.

As clearly shown in the sections that follow, this decoder device
plays a vital role in altering the data directed to the matrix—generating
schemes already presented in Chapter 4.

Figure 11—2 shows a simple 4-frame animation sequence. The
ﬁgure in this case is that of a man walking into or out of the plane of
