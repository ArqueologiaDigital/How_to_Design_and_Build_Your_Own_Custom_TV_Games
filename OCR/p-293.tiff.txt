So if a ﬁgure happens to be moving with M=6 in the horizontal
direction, it is moving downward and to the left. And since the
downward velocity is 0.48 screens/second and the left velocity is
—0. 73 screens/second, it follows that it is moving at a relatively
sharp downward angle. If you are familiar with the mathematical
procedures for drawing vectors and solving them, you can deter—
mine the exact angle and speed.

It is, in fact, quite tempting to digress from the main topic and
indulge ,in some vector analyses of the data in Fig. 7-22. The results»
could be quite useful, but the matter is better left to reader’s who
have the knowledge and initiative for doing the job.

Returning to the matter of multiplying the speed components of
the secondary ﬁgure, look at the table and circuit in Fig. 7-23. The
left-hand side of the table shows 10 different slipping-counter con-
trols that might be present at the control inputs of the primary-
ﬁgure-motion—control board. There are actually as many as 16 possi-
ble motion-control codes, but many of them are invalid in the context
of our 2x vector logic system. The 8 valid codes are for M values
from 5 through 12. The values of 4 and 13 are shown on the table to
illustrate the nature of the invalid conditions, but the list also should
include 13 through 15 and 0 through 3.
