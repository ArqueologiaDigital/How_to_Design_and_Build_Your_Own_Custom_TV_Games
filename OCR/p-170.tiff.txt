Now the greater the frequency difference, the faster the appa-
rent motion becomes. If the slipping counter is set so that it short-
counts four pulses per frame, it moves upward about four times as
fast as it does when short counting just one pulse per frame. Long
counting four pulses per frame, by the same line of reasoning, makes

' the image move downward rather rapidly.

The table in Fig. 5-13 shows ﬁve 4-bit words that can be loaded
into the vertical-motion-slipping-counter circuit. When that number
is 1001 (decimal 9) the slipping counter runs at the same frequency
as the vertical—count generator in the Sourcebox unit, and the result
is a motionless image on the screen.

Loading decimal 8, 7, 6, or 5, however, forces the slipping
counter to long-count by 1, 2, 3, or 4 HRST pulses per frame,
yielding an image that moves downward at the rate of 1, 2, 3, or 4
scan lines per frame. (Since there are 60 frames completed each
second, it is possible to calculate the time it takes the image to move
down the screen.) '

According to the table in Fig. 5-13, loading the decimal equiva-
lents of 10, 11, 12, or 13 causes the image to move upward. The
counter actually short-counts by 1, 2, 3, or 4 scan lines per frame in
this instance.

All of this discussion merely indicates what the circuit in Fig.
5-13 does. Now it is time to investigate exactlyhow it does the job.

Anyone familiar with the fundamentals of digital electronics
ought to recognize the two-counter portion of the circuit as an 8—bit
synchronous binary counter. The counters are clocked by the HRST
input to pin 14 of both IC’s. Note, however, that the counters are
disabled thrugh the VBLANK interval by means of the VBLANK
signal applied to the G (enable) input of 1C1. The circuit is thus
allowed to count at the HRST rate only as long as VBLANK is at logic
O—at all times except through the VBLANK interval.

The 2-input NAND gate normally shows a logic-1 output, drop—
ping to logic 0 only when the counter outputs reach a maximum count
of 11111111. At that instant, the 2-input NAND gate sees a pair of
logic-1 inputs, and its output drops to 0.

Whenever the output of IC3-A drops to logic 0, the two counter
ICs are loaded with a certain set of binary numbers. 1C2 is always
loaded with 0000 virtue of the fact that its preset inputs are perma-
nently tied to logic-0 common. 1C1, however, is loaded with what-
ever 4—bit number appears at its preset inputs, PA through PD, and
that number is the motion code described in the table accompanying
the diagram in Fig. 5-13.
