256P input and the one on the right is the 1P bit. You should ﬁnd a 1H
line running down the center of the screen.

What is happening here? By programming the P inputs to
100001010, you are asking the circuit to look for that particular
pattern of Is and Os from the H-count outputs of the Sourcebox. And
since that particular H-count occurs at the center of the screen, it
follows that the comparator circuit generates its output at that
particular moment. See the master counting table in Chapter 2 for
other program patterns.

There are two conditions that will not show a line on the screen.
If the program inputs specify an H—count in the horizontal blanking
region, the comparator generates a line ﬁgure, but it is lost in the
blanking region. In the other case, you can program counts that are
larger than the number of H—counts in a line—larger than binary
111000110 or decimal 454. In this instance, you are asking the circuit
to look for a number that Sourcebox never generates, and as a
result, the line is never generated at all.

The same basic ideas apply when using this comparator scheme
with V-count inputs. Here the circuit generates a horizontal line that
is 1V wide and in a position determined by the pattern of logic levels
at the P inputs. As in the case of the horizontal-comparison experi-
ment, programs calling for a line in the vertical—blanking region or
any calling for a line at 100000101 (decimal 261) or more do not
generate visible lines.

So if the circuit in Fig. 8-2a is wired for H-count programming,
you can ﬁx the position of a 1H vertical line anywhere on the screen
between 000000000 (extreme left side) and 11100101 (extreme
right side). The pattern of Os and Is at the P inputs correspond
exactly to the inputs to a NAN D gate as speciﬁed in Chapter 3. In
essence, this comparator circuit works as a 9-input NAN D gate for
ﬁxing the size and position of a line on the screen. The only differ-
ence here is that the programming can be changed much easier than
for a hard-wired NAND gate.

Once you have built this comparator circuit and you are certain
you understand how to program the P inputs to set the position of the
lH—wide vertical line, set the position to some convenient viewing
place on the screen, and connect the 1P input to the 1H input. Now
input 1 and 1P are both operating from 1H. They are always equal.
The result is a line that is ZH-clock-pulses wide. You can still adjust
the position of the line from program inputs 2P through 256P, but
now the line is wider.

Then connect 2P to input 2 and 2H. With the two lower-order
program inputs thus connected to their respective H—count inputs,
