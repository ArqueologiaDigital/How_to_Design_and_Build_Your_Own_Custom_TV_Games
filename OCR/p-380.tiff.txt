sequence. (See the application of HIT in connection with the
Stormtrooper board in Fig. 8-31.)

Finally, recall that the game is automatically stopped under any
one of three conditions: (1) all stormtroopers are killed, (2) good guy
is hit, or (3) the line of stormtroopers reaches the good guy’s
position. These three conditions come together at IC4—C in Fig.
8-32. The BALL input from the Stormtrooper board senses when all
troopers are killed off, the output of IC6-F senses the condition
where the good guy is hit, and IC3-D senses the condition where the
vertical components of the stormtroopers and good guy are on the
same level—the stormtroopers reach the good guy’s position.

The output of IC4—C goes to logic 1 whenever any one of these

three resetting conditions occurs, and the signal is inverted to the
required RST signal by IC6-E.

 

Stormtrooper Attack Wiring Diagram

This is a relatively simple game, considering its special slow-
motion and memory features. It can be built around three circuit
boards as shown in Fig. 8-33, and put into action after selecting the
values of C4 and C5 on the Control board.

Since the circuit does not use any of the power-gobbling slipping
counters, the +5V power sources from Sourcebox can be rather
evenly divided between the boards and control panel.
