Fig. 3-19. A simplified rectangle-building or sculpturing circuit

Rather than inverting the output of each line—generating circuit,
applying the signals to a NAND gate and then inverting the result,
simply take the outputs directly from the line—generating NAND
gates and apply them to the inputs of a 2—input NOR gate—one
section of a 7402 quad 2-input NOR IC package. Compare the basic
Tinkerbox rectangle—generating circuit in Fig. 3-18 with the
simpliﬁed N OR—gate version in Fig. 3—19.

The circuit in Fig. 3-19 takes advantage of one of De Morgan’s
logic theorems that says two signals can be ANDed together by
performing a NOR operation on inverted logic inputs. Well, the
signals from the line—generating NAN D gates are really inverted
versions of the lines they are to generate. (Note that those outputs
generate black lines on a white ﬁeld.) 80 running them directly to a
NOR gate yields an ANDed output; and that’s exactly what the
rectangle—building operation is based on.

NOR gates are used quite frequently throughout this book
where it is necessary to AND together signals that are already in an
inverted state. Using that one NOR gate eliminates the need for at
least three inverter circuits.

COMBINING ANY NUMBER OF STATIC FIGURES ON THE SCREEN

Single lines, bars, and rectangles—the sort of ﬁgures described
throughout this chapter—have little value in themselves. Two or
