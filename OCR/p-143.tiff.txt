Fig. 5-3. Circuit for windowing the line generated by the circuit in Fig. 5-2.

tal path. What’s involved in making that modiﬁcation? Simply modify
the circuit in Fig. 5-2 to create a movable vertical line, then window it
with V-count signals from the Sourcebox Unit.

The circuit in Fig. 5-3, combined with the appropriate movable
line generator in Fig. 5-2, is the basis for virtually all player-
controlled motion of simple lines or rectangles along a ﬁxed horizon-
tal or vertical path.

Many video game designs, however, call for full horizontal and
vertical control. The circuit in Fig. 5-4 is the basis for such a scheme.

The circuit in Fig. 5—4 is simply a composite of two motion
control circuits. The portion of the circuit built around timer ICZ-A is
a vertical-line generator, While the portion built around IC2-B is a
horizontal-line generator. Both lines can be positioned by means of
their respective controls, R1 and R4.

The two movable lines are ANDed together to yield a rectangle
signal that can be positioned anywhere on the screen. Control R1
moves the rectangle in a horizontal direction, while R4 moves it in
the vertical direction.

Working with this relatively simple circuit ought to conjure up a
whole lot of ideas for custom video games that require full control of
motion by at least one player. In fact you are now in a position to
develop the first and simplest sort of TV games—a game of tag.
