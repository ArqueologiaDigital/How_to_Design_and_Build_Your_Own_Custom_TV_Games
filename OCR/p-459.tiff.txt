inverting operation between D2 and D25, and that is performed by
IC3-D.

Finally, it can be seen from Fig. 11-3c that D17 is equal to B0.
50 the ﬁnal D connection is one where the B0 output of IC2—A is
connected directly to the D17 input of the matrix generator.

The circuit as described to this point is capable of distinguishing
frames 1 and 2. What remains is the procedure for inverting the
direction of horizontal counting in order to produce the mirror
images for frames 3 and 4. This is accomplished by inverting the
H-count inputs to select lines SO, 81, and 82 while Blzl. And it is a
simple matter of running these H-count levels through EXCLUSIVE
OR gates, IC4—A through IC4-C. Whether these select lines count
forward or in reverse depend on the logic level from IC2-B, counting
forward while B1=0 (frames 1 and 2) and counting in reverse while
B1=1 (frames 2 and 3).

The 2-bit binary counter composed of IC2-A and IC2-B thus
generates a sequence of four binary numbers, each representing one
of the four frames in the animation sequence. The rate of counting is
ﬁxed by the SSS-type astable multivibrator, IC-l. Adjusting the
RATE control sets the animation rate.

The H—count speciﬁcations shown in Fig. 11-4 generate a ﬁgure
that is 32H x 32V in size. The recommended window inputs set the
position of the ﬁgure near the lower right—hand corner of the screen.
Of course all these H- and V—count signals can come from a slipping
counter circuit, thereby making it possible to move the animated
ﬁgure around the screen while it is going through its walking mo-
tions.

The RUN/STOP input to 101 gives the experimenter the
option of ﬁxing the figure in its frame-1 position, while the
BLAN K/UN BLAN K input to the matrix generator allows the entire
ﬁgure to be blanked from the screen.

This particular animation sequence does not call for an applica-
tion of the 2-line-to-4—line decoder described in Fig. 11-1. Before
leaving this discussion of ﬁgure animation, we should look at a
somewhat more complicated case where this circuit becomes a
valuable asset.

Figure 11—5 shows an 8-frame animation sequence. The object
in this case is a tereter-totter on a pedestal. Ultimately the eight
frames will be ﬂashed onto the screen in rapid sequence, giving the
visual impression of a teeter-totter action (an action, incidentally,
that is part of a very popular coin-operated TV game).
