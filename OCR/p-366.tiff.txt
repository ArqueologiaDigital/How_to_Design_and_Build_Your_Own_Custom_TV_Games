The GAME END block also responds to a condition signalled by
the GV=SV block. The GV=SV block is responsible for sensing the
fact that one or more of the live stormtroopers have reached the
good guy’s position.

The ﬁgure boardshgwn in Fig. 8-30 contains all the circuitry for
the game’s master R—Sﬂip-flop control, stormtrooper motion,
ﬁgure-position information for the good guy, and the good guy’s
ﬁring circuit. __ _

Depressing the START pushbutton sets the R—S flip—ﬂop,
ICZ-A and ICZ-B, to a condition that allows counters 1C7 and 1C8 to
increment (count upward) at a rate determined by VRST, 60 Hz.
These counters provide position—programming information to com-
parators 1C5 and 1C6. According to the equations in Fig. 8-13, the
counter/ comparator system ought to move the stormtrooper
ﬁgures through one complete screen cycle in 71 seconds. The
stormtroopers, however, do not have to make one complete cycle
before they reach the good guy’s position. So the actual playing time
is no longer than about 60 seconds.

The signal from pin 6 of 1C6 is thus a 1V-wide horizontal line that
moves slowly down the screen. IC4—F inverts this signal and applies
it to a monostable multivibrator, IC9—A, where the position pulse is
transformed into a wider bar that is about 8V wide. This timer
actually sets the height of the stormtrooper ﬁgures.

Inverter IC4-A merely inverts the signal so that it has a phase
that is appropriate for some of the control operations on the Control
board in Fig. 8-32.

IC9—B in Fig. 8-30 is part of a motion-control circuit described in
Chapter 5. Its GHPOS input comes from the MOTION potentio-
meter and lets the player set the horizontal position of the good-guy
ﬁgure. Capacitor C2 is part of a pulse-generator circuit that ﬁxes the
width of the good-guy ﬁgure.

The horizontal position of the good guy is ﬁxed by the V-count
inputs to ICI-A, and then transformed into a pulse by IC1-B and
IC4—E. Capacitor C3 ﬁxes the height of the good-guy ﬁgure, while
ICl-C is used merely for generating a CV signal for control pur-
poses.

IC3 is the FIRE timer for the good guy. Whenever the player
depresses the FIRE pushbutton, this timer generates a positive
GFP pu§e_that lasts about 0.5 second.

A RST pulse at the input 9_f_I_C2-B signals the end of a game
sequence, generating a logic-O CLR level that stops the counters and
initializes the position of the stormtroopers.
