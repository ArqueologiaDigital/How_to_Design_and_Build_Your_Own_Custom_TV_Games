cerned, they select the same data input on both ICs at the same
time. The scheme works very much like a two-deck rotary switch.

What, then, is the role of the S4 input? Ultimately, the purpose
of the S4 input is to make certain the two multiplexers are never
enabled at the same time. If this 5th—bit input happens to have a
logic-0 level, for instance, it can enable multiplexer IC5 and disables
1C6. Setting select input S4 to logic 1, on the other hand, makes it
possible to disable IC5 and enable 1C6.

ICs 5 and 6 are thus both disabled at the same time; or,
according to the logic state of S4, one is enabled while the other is
disabled. It is not possible to enable both multiplexers at the same
time. (Both multiplexers are disabled by the window inputs, a circuit
described a bit later in this section.)

Now consider all ﬁve system-select inputs at the same time. As
long as the S4 select input is at logic 0, the status of the four
lower-order select inputs (SO through 83) select one of the 16 data
inputs to IC5. An inverted version of that particular input to IC5
appears inverted at pin 10 of that IC. 1C6, however, is disabled at
that time. And though select inputs SO through S3 might be selecting
one of the 16 inputs to 1C6, pin 10 of that IC remains ﬁxed at logic 1,
the disabled output condition.

IC5 and 1C6 change roles when S4 goes to logic 1. [CG then
outputs its selected data to its pin-10 connection, and IC5 is disabled.

Data inputs D0 through D15 are thus relevant only as long as
select input S4 is at logic 0. In a similar fashion, data inputs D16
through D31 are selected only as long as select input 84 is at logic 1.

There are effectively 32 different data inputs to this system.
One of these 32 different inputs appears at the input side of the
output NAND gate, IC2—C, depending on the 5—bit binary code
appearing at the system’s select inputs. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between the 5-bit binary code presented at the
select inputs and the data input being selected. Setting the select
inputs to binary 20 (10100), for example, selects data input D20.

The window input works much the same way as all the other
ﬁgure—windowing circuits described earlier in this chapter and in
Chapter 3. In this instance, however, the window circuit keeps both
multiplexers disabled until the proper horizontal and vertical count is
reached. At that moment, on multiplexer IC or the other is enabled,
depending on the logic level of select input S4.
