moving upward, however, its direction is reversed. Neither kind of
contact with TE causes a score.

The second line in the table in Fig. 10-13a shows a more
interesting set of effects whenever the ball makes contact with ﬁxed
barriers A or B (designed A + B). If the ball is moving downward at
the time, making contact with either A or B causes it to change to an
upward direction and score 2 points. Further down the truth table, it
can be seen that the ball traveling upward can contact either of the
same two barriers, change its direction to down and score 4 points.

A brief study of the table in Fig. 10—1321 can show the entire
ball-motion and scoring rationale. The technical problem in this case
is to know which barriers, edges, or paddles the ball touches. This
can be done rather easily by means of the 3-line-to-8-line decoder
shown in Fig. 10-13b.

Whenever a hit occurs, but not one of the two sides, this IC is
enabled. (Horizontal rebounding from the left and right sides of the
playing area is handled separately.)

The decoder circuit is addressed from the same three V-counts
used for addressing the vertical portion of the ﬁgure matrix
generator in Fig. 10-9. If a hit thus occurs when 128V, 64V, and 32V
are all at logic 0, for example, the ball must be hitting the bottom
edge of the playing area (BE), simply because that is the only ﬁgure
being generated when 128V, 64V, and 32V are all at logic 0 at the
same time.
