dent of its primary counterpart until an ATRST pulse occurs. The
ATRST pulse resets the ﬂip-ﬂop and returns FIRE to logic 1,
thereby superimposing the AT ﬁgure onto the AC ﬁgure.

The block diagram in Fig. 7-15c represents the game logic
portion of the system. Studying this block diagram in conjunction
with the two previous block diagrams and the ﬂow chart in Fig. 7-10
should lead to a good understanding of what this part of the system
does.

The target ﬁgure, located in the lower right-hand corner of the
screen, is ﬁxed by a set of H- and V-count inputs from the Sourcebox
unit. An inverted version of the target image is then directed to the
AT=TARG logic block which generates a set of pulses whenever
the attack craft ﬁgure (AFT) touches the target ﬁgure.

Whenever AT=TAGR in this fashion, the logic block sets the
target ﬂash time to indicate a score for the aggressor. The target
image is ﬂashed at a rate determined by the TARG FLASH block and
for an interval ﬁxed by TARG FLASH TIME.

At the end of the target ﬂashing time, a pulse generator pro-
duces a pulse that resets the attack-torpedo image back to the
attack-craft image ——wherever it might be at the time.

ED GEZ is not displayed on the screen, but it plays a vital role in
the game. Recall that EDGEZ is deﬁned as the top, bottom, and
right-hand edge of the screen. The EDGEZ logic block generates
this set of invisible boundaries from VBLAN K (top and bottom) and
HRST (right-hand edge).

AT=EDGE2 LOGIC compares EDGEZ with ATFIG.
Whenever they coincide, indicating the attack torpedo is running out
of bounds, this block generates a pulse that ultimately resets the
position of the attack torpedo back to the attack-craft ﬁgure.

The EDGEl LOGIC block uses VBLANK to deﬁne the invisi~
ble top and bottom boundaries. Whenever the attack-craft ﬁgure
(ACFIG) touches one of these two boundaries, the AC=EDGE1
LOGIC block generates a pulse that initiates a ﬂashing time for the
attack-craft image. This represents a default score for the defensive
player. The aggressor has run his craft out of bounds.

The attack-craft ﬁgure is also ﬂashed whenever the AC =TARG
block senses contact between the attack craft and the target. Again,
this represents a default score for the defensive player.

And ﬁnally, the attack-craft ﬁgure is ﬂashed when AC=DT (a
defense torpedo strikes the attack craft). The AC=DT LOGIC block
takes care of this operation.

The AC FLASH TIME is thus set under any one of three
conditions: AC=EDGE1, AC=TARG, and AC=DT. All three in-
