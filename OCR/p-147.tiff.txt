its Q output is set to logic 0. This Q output from IC7-A is connected
to the reset inputs of all four timer circuits. And when Q is set to zero
by the contact detector, it disables all four timers, sweeping the
rectangles into the systems horizontal and vertical blanking regions.

Whenever the two rectangles touch, then, they both disappear
from the screen. That is a clear indication that contact has been
made. Resetting the game is a matter of ﬁrst adjusting at least one of
the motion controls to a different position, and then striking the
RESET switch.

Striking the RESET pushbutton sets the Q output of 1C7 -A
back to logic 1. This enables the timers to allow another “tag” play to
begin. One of the controls must be changed before hitting the
RESET button, however. Without changing one of the controls, the
system would remain in its “tag” mode and the rectangles could not
appear on the screen.

A somewhat reﬁned and more challenging version of this tag
game is presented in a later chapter.

The circuit in Fig. 5-5 uses only seven ICs. These ICs and the
associated components (except the player controls) can be mounted

on the standard plug-in board. (Radio Shack 276—153). Using the pin
numbers speciﬁed in parentheses, the board can be plugged directly
into the Sourcebox unit.

The two sets of player controls can be mounted in separate
projectboxes. Cables running between the circuit board and project
boxes require only three wires: one for +5V and one to each of the
two ﬁxed timing resistors (R2 and R4 for player A, and R6 and R8 for
player B).

The players can toss a coin to see who is “it,” then that player
chases the other around the screen until a “tag” is made. The players
can then switch roles. Obstacle and timing circuits described later in
this book can enhance the quality of the game quite a bit. This one,
though, represents the simplest sort of TV game that has any real
playing interest.

ADDING “lNERTIA” TO THE PLAYER CONTROLS

The player—controlled positioning circuits described thus far in
this chapter have an unrealistic quickness about them. It is possible
to drive the rectangle across the screen in a mere fraction of a
second. The simple modiﬁcation described here gives the controls
some inertia, lending a more realistic kind of motion to the rectangle.

The circuit in Fig. 5-6 is built around the monostable timer that
is used in all previous player-controlled circuits. The timing interval,
however, is adjusted in this instance by R7 instead of R1.
