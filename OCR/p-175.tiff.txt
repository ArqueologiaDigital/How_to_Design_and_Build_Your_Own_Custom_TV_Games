Fig. 5-14. A slipping-counter control for horizontal speed and direction.

Setting the pin-1 control at logic 0, however, shifts the outputs
to the four inputs appearing at pins 2, 5, 11, and 14. Since the logic
level at pin 1 is determined by the output of a NAND gate, 1C6, it
follows that the system sees something other than the stop code
only when all inputs to the NAND gate are at logic 1. And these
inputs come from VBLANK and a selection of V-count signals from
the Sourcebox.
