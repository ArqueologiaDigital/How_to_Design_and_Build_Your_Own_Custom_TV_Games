Fig. 10-4. Motion code table for rebound effects based on slipping-counter
motion.

Figure 10-7a shows this pinball game as it appears on the
screen. The main playing area is the black rectangle situated near
the center of the screen. The ball is a 4H X 4V square that remains
in the playing area by virtue of the rebounding effects. It rebounds to
the left or right from the white sides of the playing area, and it
rebounds up or down from the ﬁve ﬁxed barriers and either of the
two movable paddles near the bottom of the screen.

The player’s control panel is shown in Fig. 10-7b. It consists of
three normally-open pushbuttons labeled PLAY, BALL and PAD-
DLE. Depressing the PLAY button starts the playing action, setting
the ball counter and score to zero. Depressing the BALL button
launches a ball, and depressing the paddle button makes the two
paddle figures move from their normal resting positions at the edges
of the playing ﬁeld to the center as shown in Fig. 10-7a.

Figure 10-7c shows the wiring diagram for this simple control
panel.

The playing field is shown in much greater detail in Fig. 10—8a. A
White line across the top of the screen, labeled TE, is the top of the
playing area, while the line across the bottom, BE, is the bottom of
the playing area. The left and right edges, LE and RE, aren’t lines at
all, but rather borders marking the sides of the black playing field.
