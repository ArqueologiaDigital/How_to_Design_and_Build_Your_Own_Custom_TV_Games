NOTES:

(1) Ella?) is wired-AND logic servln as blanking input
(—5-!) end/or ripple-blanking output (RBO . The blanking
out (E) must be open or held at a HlGH level when
output functions 0 through 15 are desired, and ripple-
blanking input (Fiﬁ) must be open or at e HIGH level
if blanking of a decimal O is not desired. X=input may he
HIGH or LOW.
When a LOW level is applied to the blanking input
(forced condition) all segment outputs go to 3 LOW level,
regardless of the state of any other input condition.
When ripple-blanking input (m and inputs A, B, C,
and D are at LOW level, with the lamp test input at HIGH
level, all segment outputs go to a HIGH level and the
ripple-blanking output (RBO) goes to e LOW level
(response condition).
(4) When the blanking Input/rippIa-blenking output (El—i
HBO) Is open or held at 3 HIGH level, and a LOW level
is applied to lamp-test input, ell segment outputs go to a
LOW level.
