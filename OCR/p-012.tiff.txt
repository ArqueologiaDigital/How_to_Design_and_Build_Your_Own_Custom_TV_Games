the right-hand edge, it is ﬁrst blanked off and then sent back to the
left-hand edge to begin the next scanning operation.

This horizontal seaming operation continues until the beam
reaches the lower right-hand edge, at which time it is blanked off and
returned to the top to begin a new framing sequence.

The raster as it appears on the screen is thus a series of straight
lines that result from two different kinds of operations: a relatively
fast horizontal scan, combined with a relatively slow vertical scan.
The horizontal scanning is responsible for moving the beam from left
to right, and the vertical seaming is responsible for setting each line
a bit below the previous one.

Figure 1-1b shows the sort of sawtooth waveform that is used
for both horizontal and vertical scanning. As the sawtooth level rises
with time, the beam responds by moving a proportional distance
across the screen. Two such waveforms are required, one for the
horizontal- and another for the vertical-scanning operations.

The only difference between the horizontal- and vertical-
sawtooth waveforms is their frequency. The horizontal sawtooth
waveform runs at a frequency on the order of 15,750 Hz, while the
vertical version runs at about 60 Hz. It can be reckoned from these
ﬁgures that there are 262.5 horizontal scan lines for each vertical
scan. The American television scheme, however, uses an interlaced
scanning technique calling for two complete vertical scans for one
frame.

The framing rate is thus 30 Hz, and there are 525 horizontal
lines (262.5 on the ﬁrst ﬁeld and another 262.5 on the interlaced
ﬁeld) in each complete frame.

None of the TV game schemes in this book use interlaced
scanning, so the ﬁgures relevant to our purposes are the 15,750 Hz
horizontal-scanning rate and the 60-Hz vertical-scanning rate.

The horizontal— and vertical-sawtooth waveforms are gener-
ated within the receiver by the horizontal and vertical oscillators.
When receiving a TV signal from a broadcast station or TV game
system, these oscillators must be synchronized in order to hold the
picture together properly. Vertical rolling or horizontal tearing of a
video signal are familiar signs of a loss of sync from the incoming
video signal.

Figure 1-1c shows a typical video signal as it arrives from a
conventional TV station. The horizontal-sync pulses ride in a pig-
gyback fashion on the horizontal-blanking pulses. Since there are far
more horizontal-scanning operations than vertical ones, it follows
that the composite video signal is dominated by horizontal sync and
blanking pulses.
