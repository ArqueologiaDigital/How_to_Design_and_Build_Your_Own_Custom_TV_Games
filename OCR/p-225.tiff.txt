four switches. As shown in the example in Fig. 6-20, a player can
enter vertical-motion data by ﬁrst setting the positions of the data
select switches (SA through SD) to the desired combinations of 15
and 0s and then depressing the LOAD V MOTION pushbutton for a
moment. Depressing that particular button ultimately applies a
logic-1 level to the control inputs of 1C2, thereby writing that combi-
nation of Is and Os into the memory. The VC outputs of 1C2 then
retain that data until the LOAD V MOTION button is depressed
agam.

Vertical-position data can be entered in the same fashion, de-
pressing LOAD V POSITION in this case.

The data from the select switches can be loaded into the output
latches in any desired sequence and at any time. Some speciﬁc
examples cited later in this book include some special automatic
controls for locking out the programming operations through certain
critical phases of the game.

THE TAGALDNG FEATURE

You might be familiar with commercial TV games that have a
movable ﬁgure that can be positioned anywhere on the screen by
means of a player control. This ﬁgure, however, also carries a
“missile” of its own. The missile goes wherever the primary ﬁgure
goes—at least until the player “launches” it.

For our purposes here, we will refer to this notion of one ﬁgure
being carried along by another as a tagalong feature. In a sense, a
secondary ﬁgure tags along with a primary movable ﬁgure until the
player somehow indicates the secondary ﬁgure should “ y” on its
own.

The block diagram in Fig. 6-21a shows how the tagalong feature
can be incorporated with a primary ﬁgure that moves in a horizontal
direction. You can see that this particular circuit calls for two
horizontal-slipping-counter circuits, one for the primary ﬁgure and
another for the secondary, or tagalong, ﬁgure.

For the sake of simplicity, the primary ﬁgure has no initialization
circuitry. And since this is the case, the primary slipping counter
generates HM outputs that deﬁne a continuous horizontal motion.
(Of course the speed and direction of that motion is determined by
the primary counter’s HC inputs.)

As long as the INTC input to the secondary-ﬁgure initialization
circuit is set at logic 0, the secondary slipping counter takes its reset
pulses from HMRST output of the primary-ﬁgure counter. The
secondary counter is thus synchronized to the primary counter,
