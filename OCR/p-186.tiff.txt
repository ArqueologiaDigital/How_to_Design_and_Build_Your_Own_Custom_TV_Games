output of that gate suddenly drops to logic 0. This transition from 1 to
0 initiates a short, active-low pulse at the STOP output.

The STOP pulse from the circuit in Fig. 6-3a lasts only as long
as the time constant of C1 and R1 allow. To get another pulse, one or
more of the input parameters must return to logic 0. And after that,
another pulse can be generated when all the inputs go to logic 1 once
again.

The circuit in Fig. 6—3b uses a 555-type timer to generate an
active—high STOP pulse. This pulse is initiated whenever the de-
vice’s TRIG and RST inputs see a transition from logic 0 to logic 1.
The pulse has a duration roughly equal to the product of R1 times C1.
And for most purposes, the values shown in the diagram are suitable
for generating a 10 ms pulse.

The input to the timer circuit makes the critical O-to-l transition
whenever the two active—low stop parameters at NOR gate IC2-A
are at logic 0 at the same time. The alternate circuit, made up of
NAND gate ICZ-A and an inverter, do the same job, with the
advantage of being able to work with more than two input paramet-
ers at the same time. If you use the NAN D/invert combination
(instead of the N OR—gate version) the STOP pulse is initiated
whenever all the active-low stop parameters go to logic 0 at the same
time.

Both of these circuits generate an output pulse whenever the
input stop parameters—conditions sensed Within the game cycle—
are met. Both generate a single pulse that can occur again only after
the game has left the reset condition and enters it again.

The RESET output in Fig. 6-3a and the RESET terminal in Fig.
6—3b aren’t used often, but they can be handy in a few instances.
These logic levels merely indicate whether or not the system is in its
reset condition, or to be more precise, whether or not the system is
ready to enter its reset condition.

Either of the circuits in Fig. 6-3 can be used for automatic start
operations as well. It’s all a matter of connecting the pulse outputs to
the appropriate START inputs in Fig. 6-1.

Delayed Start/Stop Operations

It is frequently desirable to insert a time delay between the
moment a particular game response occurs and the initiation of a new
game or game cycle. In a typical table-tennis game, for instance,
there is a short time delay inserted between the time a player misses
