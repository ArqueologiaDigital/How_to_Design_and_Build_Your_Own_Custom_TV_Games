By the same token, suppose a hit occurs while 128V, 64V, and
32V are all at logic 1. The only ﬁgures being generated at that
moment are the paddles, PL and PR, or PL’ and PR’. Thus a hit
under those circumstances must be the paddles, and nothing else.

The outputs of the decoder in Fig. 10-13 thus indicate a hit and,
more speciﬁcally, a hit against a particular object on the screen. The
only relevant information missing is that telling Whether the ball is
moving upward or downward at the time. And that little problem is
solved by using a pair of identical decoders, one that is enabled only
when the ball is moving upward and another that is enabled when the
ball is moving downward. See IC7 and 1C8 on the control board in
Fig. 10-14.

Before it is possible to see exactly how the hit and scoring
decoders do their jobs, it is necessary to explain the origins of signals
detennining whether the ball is moving upward or downward at the
time. Note the VC outputs in Fig. 10-14. These are the vertical
speed and direction codes for the ball’s slipping-counter circuit.

lVC and 4VC are ﬁxed at a logic-1 level, while 2VC is ﬁxed at
logic 1. According to the vertical-speed control table in Fig. 7-22,
this means the vertical section of the slipping counter will see either
0101 or 1101, where the most-signiﬁcant bit (8VC) is the only one
allowed to change. It turns out that the ball moves downward at a
rate of about 0.64 frames per second when 8VC=0, and upward at
the same rate when 8VC=1.

- The 8VC output of the control board—or more speciﬁcally, the
output of IC5-B—determines the hall’s direction of vertical motion:
0 yields down, and 1 yields up.

Now suppose the ball happens to be moving upward. The
output of IC5—B is at logic 1, and the logic-1 level is fed back to the
pin-5 input of NAND gate IC4—A. This particular NAND gate re-
sponds with a logic-0 output only when three conditions are satisﬁed
at the same time: the ball is moving downward, a hit pulse is taking
place, and the hit is NOT against one of the sides of the playing area.
ICS is thus the down-motion hit detector and score decoder.

1C7, on the other hand, is the up-motion detector/ decoder
which is enabled only when: the ball is moving upward (a logic 1 from
IC5-A), a hit occurs, and the hit is NOT against one of the two sides
of the playing area. The output of IC5-A, incidentally, is always the
complement of that from lC5—B; therefore, it is virtually impossible
to enable 1C7 and 1C8 at the same time.

_ The next step in explaining the operation of this system is to
work through the logic standing between the detector/decoders
