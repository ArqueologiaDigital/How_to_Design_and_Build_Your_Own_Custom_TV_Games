multiplexer provides 16 more basic cell locations. Most experimen-
ters, however, begin questioning the feasibility of expanding the
complex-ﬁgure generating system beyond a certain point.

Is the ability to create a large and highly detailed pattern worth
the trouble of working with all the multiplexer hardware? Only you
can answer that question. It depends on what you are trying to do
and what it’s worth to you in the long run.

This section deals with an especially useful 64—cell generator. It
is built around four 16:1 multiplexer ICs, thus giving the experi-
menter 64 data-input programming terminals. As described earlier
in this chapter, any basic multiplexer—type ﬁgure generator can be
easily modiﬁed to double the number of matrix cells. In this particular
case, the experimenter has access to 128 cells. Then the user might
elect to use a foldover scheme, thereby extending the number of
cells to 256.

It turns out that this 64-, 128-, 256-cell matrix system is
adequate for generating some of the most popular ﬁgures found on
commercial TV games: cowboys, baseball players, tanks, aircraft of
all sorts, an endless variety, really. Just look at some of the patterns
used as examples through the remainder of the section.

The 64-Cell Generator Circuit

The 64-cell generator circuit in Fig. 4-26 uses four 16:1 multi-
plexer ICs. The 4 lower-order select inputs to the system, 80
through 83, select one of the 16 data inputs on each multiplexer. And
the demultiplexer circuit, ICE), is responsible for enabling one of the
four multiplexers, depending on the status of the two higher—order
select inputs, S4 and SS.

The system is windowed and the outputs of the multiplexers
are NANDed in a fashion identical to the 32—cell generator in Fig.
4-17.

The purpose of the four inverters, ICl-A through lCl-D, re-
quire some special explanation. It is a fact of TTL technology that
most ICs in that family are capable of driving up to 20 other TTL-
type circuits. Normally a gate drives far less than 20 others, so the
problem of overloading the output never becomes an important
design factor.

When using the matrix-extension technique (expanding the cell
count from 64 to 128 in Fig. 4-26) one of the H- or V-count outputs
from the Sourcebox unit might have to drive 20 or 30 D inputs at the
same time. Whenever a particular complex-pattern circuit calls for
driving more than about 15 D inputs from the same source, that
source ought to be buffered. And that’s the purpose of 1C1.
