4 x 8 EXTENDED MATRIX

 

 

 

Fig. 4-8. A 4 x 8 extended matrix from a basic 16-cell circuit. The Select,
Window and D-input specifications are merely examples.

Note that the extended—matrix pattern in Fig. 4-8 shows the
usual 16 cells arranged in a 4X4 pattern at the top of the rectangle.
The bottom half of the rectangle is composed of another 4 x4 matrix
with cells designated DOE, DlE, DZE, etc. The “E” sufﬁx indicates
an extended matrix cell, and whenever one of the cells in the top half
of the matrix is blackened by setting that D input to logic 0, its
extended counterpart in the bottom half of the matrix is also black-
ened.

While this procedure for generating two black squares at the
same time is a cute trick, it isn’t really very useful (unless the ﬁgure
you want to create happens to be a symmetrical one). So here is the
clincher. Remove any logic-0 connections to the D inputs of the
multiplexer and connect one end of the jumper wire to the 64V
source. Connect the other end of this jumper to the D0 input of the
multiplexer, and presto! There is a single black square in matrix
position D0. You are no longer getting the two-square effect you
found when connecting the D inputs to logic 0.

Try touching this 64V source to the multiplexer’s D inputs, one
at a time and in succession. You will be able to blacken any one of the
