A GAME OF TAG

Pursuit games are among the most popular kinds of video
games. Here is your chance to build one of them based on the
player-controlled motion circuit described in the previous section of
this chapter.

The game calls for building two independent player-controlled
motion circuits, one for player A an one for player B. The outputs of
the two circuits are essentially ORed together so that each player
can see and control the motion of his own little rectangle on the
screen.

Referring to the circuit in Fig. 5-5, player A’s circuit consists of
timers IC1-A and ICl—B, pulse-shortening circuits IC3-A, IC5-C,
IC3-B, and IC5—D, and NOR gate IC6-A. Player A controls the
horizontal position of his square by means of R1 and the vertical
position by means of R3.

Player B’s circuit is identical to that of Player A: timers ICZ-A
and ICZ-B, pulse—shortening elements IC3-C, IC5-E, IC3-D, and
IC5-F, and NOR gate ICES-B. The horizontal and vertical motion
controls in this case are R5 and R7.

The outputs of the two players’ circuits (player A from pin 1 of
IC6-A and player B from pin 4 of IC6-B) are ORed together by means
of the N OR/invert operation of IC6-C and IC4-A. The signal at that
output point is a white-on-black signal containing the video informa-
tion for positioning the little rectangles for both players.

Of course it would be possible to let the two players chase each
other around the screen, counting on human judgement to deter-
mine when a “tag” is made. One additional IC lets the machine
determine a “tag."

The “tag” detector in this instance is NAND gate IC4-B and one
section of a dual J-K ﬂip-ﬂop, 1C7 -A. Now this contact-response
circuit is the subject of a more detailed discussion later in this book,
but since it adds a nice feature to the basic game, you ought to
incorporate it at this point.

Brieﬂy, you can see that IC4-B senses a condition where the
players’ little rectangles touch one another. The two inputs to this
gate are positive-going pulses, each indicating the position of the two
rectangles. When they are at least partially superimposed, the
output of IC4-B suddenly drops from its normal logic-1 state to logic
0 (where it remains, incidentally, until the players move their re-
ctangles apart).

The instant the output of IC-B, the contact detector, shows a
transition from logic 1 to 0, it clocks the ﬂip -ﬂop to a condition Where
