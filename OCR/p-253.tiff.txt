there is contact between the attack missile and the edge of the
screen, the output of IC5-A goes to logic 1 and ultimately through
IC3-B as a pulse for resetting the position of the attack missile.

If, on the other hand, there is contact between the two missiles,
the output of IC5-C goes to logic 1. This signal is inverted by IC5-D
and applied to the trigger input of ﬂashing-timer IC7-A. The output
of that timer enables the missile-ﬂashing IC, 1C7 -B. This rectangular
waveform is inverted by 102-13 and applied to the attack-missile-
logic circuit, IC1-C. When the ﬂashing interval is over, the
negative-going edge of the timing pulse at pin 5 of IC7-A is shaped
and applied as one of two attack-missile-reset pulses to IC3-B.

Contact between the attack missile and the target is sensed by
ICZ-D in Fig. 7-7. This pulse is inverted by IC4-C in Fig. 7-8 and
used for enabling the target—ﬂashing timer, IC6-A. The ﬂashing
output from IC6—B modulates the target image from TARG at
IC4-D, where it is then inverted and ORed with the image informa-
tion for the two missiles in IC8-B.

A complete slipping-counter board is an integral part of the
system, as shown in the wiring block diagram in Fig. 7 -9. This board
is already described in connection with the circuit diagram in Fig.
5-15. Figure 7-9 merely shows how it is interfaced with the three
game boards just described.

Note carefully the programming of the 4HC, 8HC, 4VC, and
8VC connections to the slipping-counter board in Fig. 7-9. These
connections must be made in order to make the attack missile move
in the proper directions at all times.

 

Construction and Assembly Hints

Each of the boards described in this section can be built on a 4-
by 4-inch plug-in boards (Radio Shack 276-153) and interconnected
by means of edge-card connectors (Radio Shack 276-1551).

The connections on an additional mother board can be used for
interfacing the game circuits with the Sourcebox unit.

The slipping-counter board should take its +5V source from the
GAME-A power supply in the Sourcebox. The three other boards
can then operate most effectively from the GAME-B power supply.

The two control panels can be built into small aluminum project
boxes.

TDRPEDO ATTACK

Here is another two-player war game. One player controls the
motion of an attack craft (AC), and his goal is to lob a torpedo at a
