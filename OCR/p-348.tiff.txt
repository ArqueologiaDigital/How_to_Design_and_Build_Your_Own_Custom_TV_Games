to logic 1 whenever the player depresses the TEE pushbutton. RST
then remains at logic 1 until the ball makes contact with the hole,
indicatﬂg the completion of one hole of golf.

RST is connected to the reset input of the ball travel timer,
IC5-B in Fig. 8-18. So when the ball ﬁgure makes contact with the
hole, the ball-travel timer is effectively locked out, making it impos-
sible to move the ball by depressing the SWING pushbutton. This
lack of action is a clear indication the player has been successful at
hitting the hole. __

The only way to unlatch the RST signal is by depressing the
TEE switch, which moves the ball off the hole and to the initial
position for the next hole of golf.

Finally, the ball ﬁgure from IC3-A goes through inverter IC6—D
and to one input of NOR gate IC3-D. Here the ball ﬁgure is effec-
tively AN Ded with the green ﬁgure to produce a BG signal, a logic
level indicating the ball is on the green. This signal is used for slowing
down the speed of the ball and shortening the travel time. Exactly
how this signal shortens the travel time has already been described
in connection with the ball-travel timer circuit in Fig. 8-18. The ball
slowing effect will be described as part of the theory of operation for
the Game Control board that follows.

Before seeing how one of four different sets of control words is
selected, we ought to see exactly what the four options are.

This speed control system must include stop-code words for
the HC and VC outputs. This stop code is necessary for stopping the
motion of the ball whenever the ball-travel timer ends its timing
operation.

There must also be provisions for selecting one of two sources
of ball—speed information, one coming directly from the A/D conver-
ter and another that multiplies the speed from the A/ D converter by
two. The two speeds are necessary for running the ball at full speed
until it reaches the green, where the speed should be effectively cut
in half.

Some circuitry in Fig. 8-20 handles the two-speed information
in the same way it is handled for the Dogﬁght game in Chapter 7. The
, idea is to automatically change the speed of the ball vector without
changing its direction, and that is accomplished by means of the
circuit ﬁrst described in Fig. 7-23.

The circuit in Fig. 8—20 includes two of these 2x speed and
direction multipliers. One of these handles the PHC input data and
the other works with PVC data. Whenever the outputs of these two
circuits are directed through the selectors to the HC and VC out-
