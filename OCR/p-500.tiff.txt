emitter—base junction of Q1. The breakdown current is controlled at
a safe level by resistor R1. The collector on that same transistor is
not used. But the noise it generates can be ampliﬁed by Q2, and then
further ampliﬁed and adjusted to TTL logic levels by Q3 and Q4.

Since this circuit generates the noise continuously, its output
must be applied to a control circuit to give the impression of explo-
sions or gunﬁre. The circuits in Fig. 12- 6 illustrate two kinds of noise
controls.

The circuit in Fig. 12-6a uses a simple monostable multivibrator
circuit to control the on-time of the noise signal fed to the audio
ampliﬁer. The monostable is set to its active timing mode whenever
the SHOOT input experiences a brief negative-going pulse. The
positive- -going timing pulse from pin 3 of the 555 then gates on the

- NAN D gate, allowing the noise signal to pass to the audio ampliﬁer in
the Sourcebox unit.

The monostable remains in its active condition for a period of
time determined by the values of R2 and C2. In this particular
instance the timing is set for about 0.1 second, giving the impression
of a single gunshot each time a negative-going pulse appears at the
SHOOT input.

The duration of the explosion sound can be lengthened by
increasing the value of R2, thereby giving the impression of a bomb
exploding.
