The outputs controlling the ball’s horizontal motion are lHC
through 8HC in Fig. 10-14. 1HC and 4HC are ﬁxed at logic 1, while
2HC is ﬁxed at logic 0. Only the 8HC bit is concerned with the ball’s
changes in horizontal motion.

The horizontal motion codes to the horizontal portion of the
slipping-counter board are thus 0101 or 1101, depending on whether
the ball is to be moving to the right or left respectively. In either
case, the horizontal velocity is 0.98 screens per second, and
whether the ball is moving to the right or left is determined by the
status of an R— S ﬂip- ﬂop composed of IC5-C and IC5- D.

The inputs to this l__ittle hozi_z__ontal-direction control circuit are
BALL (the ball ﬁgure), LT, and RT (signals indicating the two sides
of the playing area.

To see how this circuit works, suppose the ball ﬁgure is
moving toward the right. This means the 8HC bit and the output of
IC5—D are at logic 0; and since this is one output of a ﬂip-ﬂop, it
follows that the output of ICS-C is at logic 1. Now there is a contact
between the ball and the right-hand side of the playing area. IC6-D
senses this particular hit, and generates a positive-going pulse that
resets the ﬂip—ﬂop. This action resets the ﬂip—ﬂop, changing the
direction of the hall’s horizontal motion to the left.

The complementary action takes place as the ball strikes the
left-hand side of the playing area. IC6-C senses the contact and
changes the status of the ﬂip-ﬂop so that the ball moves to the right
again.

If the experimenter ﬁnds the ball speed seems too fast, the
vertical- and horizontal—motion codes at lVC, 2VC, 4VC, 1HC,
2HC, and 4HC can be changed, using the information in the speed-
control table (Fig. 7-22) as a guide. The 8VC and 8HC bits should
remain as shown in Fig. 10-14.

The control circuit board also includes some housekeeping logic
that is mainly concerned with starti_____ng and ending the game. Note,
for instance, that the“ PLAY _a_nd BALLP signals from the control
panel each go to a separate R-S lip—ﬂop—ICI -A and IC1- B, and
IC1-C and ICl-D.

Depressing the PLAY pushbutton on the control panel forces
the PLAY input to the control board to logic 0, thus setting the
output of IC1-A to logic 1 and the output of ICEto 0. The logic-0
level from ICl-B leaves the board via the CLS connection and
ultimately clears the ball counter and score counter on the score-
counting board (Fig. 10-12). The ball count and score are thus
cleared whenever the player depresses the PLAY pushbutton at the
beginning of a new game sequence.
