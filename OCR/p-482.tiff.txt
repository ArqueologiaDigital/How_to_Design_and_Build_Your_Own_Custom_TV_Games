Fig. 11-16. Fourcritlcal frames for rotating a tank figure at 22.5-degree intervals.

There should be no reason to explain the derivation of the
circuit in Fig. 11-18 in great detail because it follows the principles
already outlined for a 4—frame animation sequence.

What is most important here is to combine the 8 x 8 90°,shift-
ing circuit (Fig. 11-15) with the 4-frame animation generator (Fig.
11-18) with the 8 X 8 extended matrix generator in Fig. 4—17.
Figure 11-19 shows how these circuits are combined. If the scheme
is combined with the control circuit in Fig. 11-20, the result is a tiny
8H x 8V tank ﬁgure that can be rotated into any one of 16 positions,
in a direction set by the logic level at the DIR input, and at a rate
determined by the setting of the RATE control.

Any custom-designed ﬁgure can be worked into this circuit.
The 90° rotator circuit never changes. Only the D-input program—
ming changes. Of course the Whole system can be systematically
