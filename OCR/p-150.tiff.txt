This technique takes advantage of the fact that a SSS-type timer
can be adjusted by means of a voltage level applied to its control
voltage input (pins 3 or 11 on the dual 556 version).

Generally speaking, pulling the control voltage input closer to
the positive supply voltage potential lengthens the timing interval.
Pulling it closer to ground, on the other hand, shortens the timing
interval.

Thus it is possible to set the basic timing range by means of R1,
R2, and C2, then vary the timing around that point by changing the
voltage level to the control voltage input.

Set up the circuit in Fig. 5-6, omitting capacitors C7 and C8 for
the time being. Connect a temporary jumper wire to the wiper arm of
control R7.

Connect the loose end of the jumper wire to COMM, and adjust
trimpot R1 so that the white vertical line appears at the extreme
left-hand edge of the screen. Then connect the jumper to +5V
instead of COMM. Adjust R1 until the vertical white line appears on
the extreme right-hand side of the screen.

You might have to repeat this operation a couple of times to get
a perfect response. The line should appear at the left-hand edge of
