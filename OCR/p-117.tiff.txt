symmetrical ﬁgures in the earlier section entitled Folding Over an
Extended Matrix. The only difference here is that you are working
With twice as many cells.

Figure 4-25 shows the 128-cell extended foldover matrix
oriented horizontally. The axis of symmetry in this case is a vertical
line through the center of the image. Set up this matrix, using the
EXCLUSIVE-OR circuit and speciﬁcations shown in Fig. 4-25. Then
work out some ﬁgures of your own, bearing in mind that the right-
hand half of the images must be mirror images of the left-hand half.

Further Experiments With the 32-, 64-, 128~Cell System

If you have been performing the experiments suggested in this
chapter thus far, you most likely have the know-how and conﬁdence
necessary for generating other matrix formats. What’s even more
important is that you ought to be coming up with additional ideas you
want to try, perhaps more-novel ideas than you have time to work
on.

Suppose, for instance, you are thinking about putting more than
one kind of complex ﬁgure on the screen. How do you go about it?
Well, you certainly have to build two different ﬁgure-generating
circuits, one for each ﬁgure you want to put on the screen. After
that, you must effectively OR together their outputs before applying
the signal to the GAME VID IN terminal of the Sourcebox unit.

Exactly how you should go about ORing together these signals
depends on whether they emerge from the ﬁgure-generating sys-
tems as white on black or black on white. All of the multiplexers in
this chapter generate inverted, black-on-white signals, but the in-
verter connected to the output of the multiplexer in Fig. 4-5 and the
NAN D gate at the outputs of the multiplexers in Fig. 4-17 reverse
the image so that it is properly shown as a white matrix on a black
background.

These “upright” signals can be ORed together (combined on
the screen) by ﬁrst running them to separate inputs of a common
NOR IC. The output of that NOR gate can then be inverted to yield a
cemposite video signal having the proper white-on-black format.

If you are confused about any procedure for combining complex
ﬁgures on the screen, you ought to review the material in the section
entitled COMBINING ANY NUMBER OF STATIC FIGURES ON
THE SCREEN in Chapter 3. The procedures described there can be
carried over to the circuits in this chapter.

MATRIX OPERATIONS FROM 64-CELL GENERATORS

The idea of expanding the cell-generating capacity by adding
more multiplexer circuits can be extended indeﬁnately. Each new
