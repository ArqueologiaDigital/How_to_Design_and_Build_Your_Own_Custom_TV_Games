Fortunately there is an alternate scheme that overcomes all
three of these disadvantages. The principle involved here is com-
monly‘called shying—counter motion. The idea is to build a horizon-
tal— or vertical-counter circuit that is practically identical to those in
the Sourcebox unit. The second counter circuit, however, runs out
of sync with those in the Sourcebox. In effect, the images created by
this slipping counter moves across the screen by virtue of the fact
they are out of sync with the Sourcebox counters creating the raster
pattern.

Slipping-Counter Vertical Motion Control

Figure 5-13 shows the basic circuit for vertical-slipping-counter
motion. In a physical sense, it is a very simple circuit, composed of
only three IC devices: two 74191 presettable 4—bit binary counters
and a 7400 2—input NAND gate.

Recall from the discussions in Chapter 2 that the Sourcebox unit
generates a vertical-scanning ﬁeld composed of 261 lines. Sixteen of
these lines are lost in the vertical retrace interval, but the point is
that the vertical-count generator in the Sourcebox counts out 261
HRST pulses per vertical frame.

Now if you could build another vertical-count generator that
counts out 261 HRST pulses per cycle, you would have a second
source of vertical—count pulses. This new counter would run at the
same rate as the one in the Sourcebox, but its reset point could occur
anywhere in the vertical ﬁeld. This circuit, in other words, would run
at the same frequency as the one in the Sourcebox, but out of
phase—out of phase anywhere between 0 and 260 HRST vertical-
clocking intervals.

Next, suppose you use this out-of-phase vertical-count
generator to create images on the screen. That image would be
motionless on the screen, but it could be shifted up or down,
depending on its phase relationship with the vertical-count generator
in the Sourcebox. The greater the phase difference between the two
counters, the greater the amount of shifting.

As an example, let the slipping counter in Fig. 5-13 run at the
same frequency as the vertical-count generator in the Sourcebox.
But let the slipping counter run out of phase to the extent that it
reaches a count of 100 while the corresponding vertical counter in
the Sourcebox is at count 150. The slipping counter would thus be
cycling 50 HRST pulses behind the Sourcebox counter, and any
image created from the vertical-count outputs of the slipping counter
would appear 50 scan lines lower on the screen than the same image
created from the vertical-count outputs of the Sourcebox.
