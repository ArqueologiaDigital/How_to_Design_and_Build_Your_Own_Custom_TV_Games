four inputs, transfer the NAND connections to one of the 4-input
NAND gates in 1C2. The idea here is to (1) free the 8-input NAND
gate for building another line and (2) reduce the circuit to the
simplest possible gate conﬁguration.

With the ﬁrst vertical line designed and reduced to the simplest
possible NAN D gate circuit form, repeat the entire process for the
second vertical line. When you are ﬁnished with this part of the
project, you should have two separate NAND-gate circuits, one for
each of the two vertical lines.

All that remains to be done is to combine the two on the TV
screen at the same time. Figure 3-6b shows how this is done. Simply
connect the outputs of the two line-generating NAND gates to the
inputs of a 2-input NAND gate. That ﬁnal NAND operation effec-
tively combines the two line signals in a logic ORing fashion, yielding
an image on the screen showing both of your designated vertical
lines. Note that there are no inverters used past the line-forming
NAND gates.

While you are working with this particular parallel-line circuit,
connect GAME VID IN to the inputs of the ﬁnal NAND-gate stage.
You will ﬁnd that the inputs to this gate each carry one of the lines
you built—but the image has the blacks and whites reversed. You
will see a black vertical line on a white ﬁeld. The lesson here is that a
NAND gate can OR together two signals if they are in an inverted
form. This effect takes advantage of something called De Morgan’s
theorem from basic texts on digital electronics.

After you’re convinced you understand how to create parallel
vertical lines of any relative width and spacing on the screen, draw an
exact diagram of your ﬁnal circuits for future reference and try the
same procedure for building pairs of horizontal lines. First build the
lines separately, using the 8—input NAND gate and inverter, then
transfer the circuit to smaller NAND-gate devices. Combine the two
lines as shown in Fig. 3-6b. Refer to the Recipe for a Horizontal Line
or Bar as necessary.

Building lntersecting Horizontal and Vertical Lines

The Line/Bar Tinkerbox assembly can be used for creating
intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. Suppose, for example, the
experimenter wants to build a tic-tac-toe pattern on the screen. This
is essentially a pair of vertical and a pair of horizontal parallel lines
combined into one picture. And if the lines are ﬁxed at the extreme

edges of the screen, it appears they are creating a border for many
different kinds of TV games.
