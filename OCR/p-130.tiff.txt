connections to the window inputs for the time being. If you use the
select and D-input speciﬁcations in Fig. 4-33a, you will find the
screen ﬁlled with rows and columns of hooke d-together Xs. (It gives
the visual impression of a small checkerboard pattern, however).

If you are having trouble visualizing the X5, window down to a
single ﬁgure with 256H, 128H, 64H, 32H, 128V, 64V, and 32V. Now
you should see a single X ﬁgure as shown in Fig. 4-33a. Remove all
these window inputs before going on to the next step of this experi-
ment.

Now the idea is to selectively eliminate some of the KS, leaving
behind a distinct pattern of them. First try applying 32H and 32V to
the windowing NAND gate. You should ﬁnd that half the Xs are
eliminated, getting rid of the confusing, hooked-together feature.
What is left is a regular pattern of horizontal and vertical X lines.

Including 64H and 64V with the 32H and 32V sources already
connected to the window inputs increases the spacing between the
rows and columns of X5. See this particular set of window speciﬁca-
tions in Fig. 4-33b.

Now remove the windowing NAND gate, 1C3, from the circuit
and replace it with a 2-input EXCLUSIVE-OR gate. As described in
connection with Fig. 3—21, you will be creating a checkerboard
pattern, a checkerboard pattern of little Xs in this case. See the
circuit and speciﬁcations in Fig. 4~33c.

Try the windowing circuit in Fig. 4-33d for a touch of special
interest, then try any of the other bar or line generators from
Chapter 3.

When you think you have mastered the art of setting patterns of
identical, square matrix ﬁgures on the screen, move on to ﬁgures
built within rectangular matrices. Most rectangular matrices de-
scribed in this chapter use the extension technique, or a combination
of extension and foldover. Such ﬁgures can be repeated any number
of times on the screen using the bar-and—rectangle windowing pro-
cedures. You will ﬁnd, however, that you must be careful when
selecting the H- and V-count speciﬁcations for the windowing cir-
cuitry.

As an example of repeating the image of an extended foldover
matrix, try the racing car ﬁgure in Fig. 4-12. Reduce the size of the
basic ﬁgure matrix two orders of magnitude as indicated in Fig. 4-34.
With no windowing at all, the little car appears repeated a large
number of times on the screen. But the ﬁgures are hooked together
in a fashion that makes the image about useless.

The little ﬁgures can be separated by eliminating alternate rows
and columns of them. The circuit in Fig. 4-34 shows the speciﬁca-
