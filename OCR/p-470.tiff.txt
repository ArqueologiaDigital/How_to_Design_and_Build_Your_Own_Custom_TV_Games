FIGURE ROTATION

Being able to move a ﬁgure around on the screen is one matter,
but making it appear to turn in the direction of motion is something
else. There are a number of popular TV games on the market today
that feature such rotation effects—an airplane that always turns in
the direction of its motion; a tank ﬁgure that rotates and moves in any
direction, but always forward; or a gun that can be rotated and aimed
in any direction.

Figure rotation is a special case of ﬁgure animation, but it calls
for even closer preliminary analysis and greater patience and insight
with the circuit design.

Figure 11-8 shows an extremely simple, almost trivial, example
of ﬁgure rotation. The image in this case is one that might be
described as an X ﬁgure on a black ﬁeld. The basic position is
represented by frame 1, while frames 2 and 3 show the same ﬁgure
rotated clockwise 30° and 60° respectively. A further rotation of 30°
would carry it to a total rotation of 90°; but since this is a completely
symmetrical ﬁgure, the 90° rotation looks exactly like frame 1.

The appearance of rotation for this simple ﬁgure is thus possible
with three different frames, and those three frames can be gener-
ated by a 4 x 4 matrix generator, such as the one shown in Fig. 4-5.
The D inputs for each frame are speciﬁed below the drawings. And in
keeping with the animation processes outlined in the ﬁrst part of this
chapter, Figs. 11-8b and 11-80 show the truth tables and equalities
required for designing the appropriate D-programming circuitry.

D0, D1, and D2 appear in Fig. 11-8b to be inverted outputs
from a 2-line-to-4-line decoder. And indeed they can be generated
that way. See 1C3 and 1C4 in Fig. 11-9. Input D5 is simply logic 1. So
it, along with the four others equal to it, is connected directly to a
+5V source.

These steps complete the D-input programming. All that re-
mains is to apply the select and windowing inputs. Using the speciﬁ-
cations in Fig. 11-9, the little ﬁgure measures 32H x 32V and is
located just below and right of the center of the screen.

As the experimenter adjusts the frequency of the 555-type
astable multivibrator, 1C1, the 3-count counter (ICZ) generates the
sequence 00, 01, 10, 00, 01...at a variable rate. The overall impres-
sion is that the figure rotates clockwise on the screen. The faster the
multivibrator runs, the faster the ﬁgure appears to rotate.
