programmed into the D inputs of the matrix generator can be rotated
to any one of four different positions.

The circuit in Fig. 11-12c shows a circuit for controlling the
rotation. Adjusting the RATE potentiometer sets the rate of rota-
tion. The logic level presented to the DIR (direction) input deter-
mines whether the ﬁgure rotates in a clockwise or counter clockwise
direction.

So how can this 90°-shift procedure be used for simplifying the
rotation of figures through much smaller increments? Rotating a
ﬁgure through 45° increments is ﬁrst a matter of working out two
D-input programs, one for the basic 0° position and another for the
45° position. One additional rotation bit is required for selecting one
of the two basic ﬁgures, while the two shown in Fig. 11-12 are
necessary for determining how much either ﬁgure is shifted.

The table in Fig. 11-13 shows the rotation sequence for turning
any 4 x 4 matrix ﬁgure through a full 360 degrees in a clockwise
direction and at intervals of 45°.

Rotation of an 8 x 8 Figure at 221/2° Intervals

The 45° rotation sequence just described is presented as an
example of how such a scheme should work. For an acceptable visual
impression of relatively smooth rotation, the ﬁgure should advance
at angles no greater than 221/2°. This section uses a speciﬁc exam-
ple, a tank ﬁgure, to show how the principles of ﬁgure animation and
90° shifting can be combined to transform a very complicated rota-
tion situation into a reasonably simple format.
