Putting this information all together, the three address lines to
the scanning system causes 1C3 to generate a sequence of outputs
representing the horizontal position of each stormtrooper, the ﬂip-
ﬂops determine whether the stormtrooper being scanned is sup-
posed to be dead or alive, and the multiplexer reassembles the
information into a single string of sequential dead-or-alive informa-
tion.

ICZ—A uses 128H and 256H inputs to window the line of
stormtrooper ﬁgures. This EXCLUSIVE-OR gate makes certain
there are never more than eight stormtroopers on the screen at any
given time, and causes them to appear fairly well centered where the
128H and 256H signals have opposite colors. This windowing infor-
mation from lCZ—A is combined with a HIT signal (HIT inverted by
ICZ—C) at ICl-B. The interaction between the HIT signal and win—
dow information will be described in a moment.

The stormtrooper information at 1C5 is also windowed by the
output of ICZ-A, but the windowing information in this case is further
reﬁned by the 8H and 16H inputs to ICl-A. These two additional
windowing parameters reduce the horizontal size of each
stormtrooper to 8H and inserts a 24H blank space between each of
them. The 24H blank is inserted so that the good guy has a chance to
slip between two adjacent stormtroopers without getting shot by
one of them.

Now suppose the game is reset for any one of three reasons: (1)
all eight stormtroopers are successfully killed, (2) any one of them
reaches the bottom of the screen, or (3) the good guy is shot by one
of the stormtroopers. This reset condition sets CLR in Fig. 8-31 to
logic 0, where it remains until the player depresses the START
button to begin another attack sequence. While CLR remains at logic
0, the preset inputs to all eight J -K ﬂip-ﬂops are pulled down to logic
0. And taking for granted that all eight outputs from 1C3 are at logic 1
at the time, the ﬂip-ﬂops are all set to a state where their Q outputs
to the multiplexer are at logic 1. Ultimately, this means all eight
stormtrooper figures can appear on the screen. In fact any
stormtrooper ﬁgure remains on the screen as long as the Q output of
its corresponding flip-ﬂop is at logic 1.

The ﬂip-ﬂops then remain in their “alive” logic-1 states until a
successful HIT occurs. Whenever the good guy manages to shoot a
given stormtrooper, {HIT pulse occurs at the windowing input (pins
2 and 14) of 1C3. The addressing scheme for the demultiplexer
works in such a way that its output is scanning the stormtrooper that
is hit, thereby setting its ﬂip-ﬂop to a logic-0 state. This indicates a
