IC8-B. IC5—C detects any contact between the attack missile and the
right-hand side of the screen, resetting the ﬂip-ﬂop composed of
IC4-B and IC4—C to a state where pin 14 of IC4-D returns to logic 1,
unblanking the attack-missile image once again.

The insert in Fig. 6—16 shows a suggested set of connections for
setting the speed and direction of the two missiles. The speed and
direction of the antiballistic missile are set by the VC connections. In
this case, 8VC must remain connected to +5V (logic 1) to make
certain it always moves upward. (See the vertical direction and
speed speciﬁcations in Fig. 5-13.) The three remaining VC connec-
tions are set for a rather high launch velocity. These can be changed
to suit your own ideas about how fast the rocket should rise,
however.

The HC inputs determine the speed and direction of the attack
missile. 8HC must remain at logic 0 to make the missile move from
left to right, but the other HC inputs can be changed to alter the
speed.

Incidentally, the fact that the speed of both missiles can be
changed by modifying the three lower-order VC and HC inputs to the
motion~control board foreshadows some interesting control circuits
to be described in the next section of this chapter. Wouldn’t it be nice
if the game were expanded so that two players can compete by
manually adjusting the speed of their respective missiles?

The entire circuit in Fig. 6-16 can be constructed on a 44-pin, 4-
by 4—inch circuit boardv(Radi0 Shack 276-153).,Then the board, along
with the motion-control board described in Fig. 5-15, can be
mounted in a simple Gamebox unit. The Gamebox can then be
plugged into the plug receptacle on the Sourcebox.

PROGRAMMING VARIABLE INITIAI.
POSITIONS, SPEED AND DIRECTION

Virtually all of the motion-control circuits described thus far in
this chapter have ﬁxed initial-position parameters as well as a ﬁxed
speed and direction program. It turns out to be rather simple,
however, to make the initial positions, ﬁgure speed, and direction
programmable, either by a player or by the internal game-control
system.

Take, for example, the missile-attack game described in the
last section. It is possible to add a lot more interest by making the
attack missile programmable as far as the attack altitude and velocity
are concerned. Of course the direction of attack can be varied as
well, but that wouldn’t be altogether appropriate in this case.
