composite image for the attack craft. The horizontal component of
this movable ﬁgure is determined by the primary-ﬁgure HM inputs
to IC5-A. And in a similar fashion, the vertical component comes
from the primary-ﬁgure VM inputs to IC5-B. The signals from IC5-A
and IC5-B are sent through pulse generators before they are effec-
tively AN Bed by IC3-A. The value of C1 ﬁxes the horizontal length
of the attack—craft ﬁgure, While C2 determines its vertical height.

ATFIG from IC3-B is the attack-torpedo ﬁgure, which is gen-
erated in a manner identical to that of the attack-craft ﬁgure. IC6-A
determines the horizontal component from the secondary-ﬁgure
HM data, and IC6-B ﬁxes the vertical component of the attack
torpedo from secondary-ﬁgure VM data. Capacitors C3 and C4
determine the “horizontal and vertical size of this ﬁgure.

The FIRE output from IC2- C 18 a logic level that equals 0
Whenever the attack torpedo is ﬁred. The ATLAUNCH signal from
the aggressor’ s control panel sets the R-S flip—ﬂop (ICZ- B and
ICZ-C) so that FIRE goes to 0 and remains there until the ATRST
(attack torpedo reset) pulse occurs

The ﬁnal Torpedo Attack control board is shown in Fig. '7-18.
This circuit performs most of the game-control functions shown in
the block diagram in Fig. 7—15c. Comparing these two ﬁgures, you
should have little trouble matching block diagram functions with the
logic components in the schematic.

AT=TARG logic, for instance, takes place at ICl-B, while
timers IC9—A and IC9-B are responsible for target-ﬂashing effects.
EDGEZ is generated by IC4-D, and the AT=EDGE2 function is
performed by IC5—C. The outputs of ICQ-A or IC5-C are ultimately
responsible for producing an ATRST pulse at the output of IC7—B.

EDGEl is present at the output of IC6-C, where it is effectively
ANDed with ACFIG in IC3-D to perform the AC=EDGE1 logic
function. AC=TARG takes place at IC4-A, while the AC=DT func-
tion takes place at IC3-C. The three inputs to the AC FLASH TIME
block in Fig. 7-15c appear at IC5-A in Fig. 7-18, and the output of
that particular NOR gate goes to ﬂash timer IC8-A where it initiates
the AC flashing interval.

The ﬁgures to be displayed on the screen are combined at
IC5-B and ICl-C. Pin 8 of ICl-C is the game’s composite video
output.

The PINTP logic level from IC6— E is responsible for res____etting
the attack craft to an initial position determined by outputs PVINT
(IC7-F) and PHINT (IC7- C). ICl- D ____a_nd its associated inverters
produce both the PVINT pulse 128P required for the tagalong
system.
