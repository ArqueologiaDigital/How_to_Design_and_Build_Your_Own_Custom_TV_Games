The program inputs can be selected by means of 18 different
toggle switches, one to each of the P inputs. Certainly this would be
a rather awkward scheme for programming the position of the
ﬁgure, but it is an alternative that is suitable in some circumstances.
See the suggested input switch circuit in Fig. 8-6.

Figure 8-5 shows an alternative to the comparator positioning
board in Fig. 8-4. The primary advantage of this alternate circuit is
that it requires only 23 pins as opposed to the full complement of 40
pins for the circuit in Fig. 8-4. The trick is to eliminate virtually all of
the H— and V-count inputs by building a set of counters on the
position-control board, itself.

The horizontal counters are 1C5 and 1C6, and since they are
clocked by 1H and reset by HRST from the Sourcebox, they follow
the basic counting pattern of the H-count system in the Sourcebox.
1C7 and IC8 perform the same function for the vertical—positioning
circuit, being clocked by HRST and reset by VRST from the Source-
box.

Using on-board H— and V-count generators thus eliminates a lot
of wiring between the board and Sourcebox. There are some trade-
offs though. The H—count generator (1C5 and 106) generates count-
ing signals between 2H and 256H. The lower—order 1H bit is not
included in the comparison process in the horizontal section. Omit-
ting the 1H comparison, however, only means that the ﬁgure is
positioned with 2H precision. And that doesn’t pose many problems,
in most instances.

There are also only eight bits available for vertical positioning.
In this case, the 256V bit is omitted. Since that particular signal is
seldom useful at all, there is little lost by leaving it out of the
comparison operation.

Also note that the circuit in Fig. 8-5 requires eight ICs, rather
than the seven in Fig. 8-4. And furthermore, you can see that the
alternate circuit generates active-high HPP and VPP signals, rather
than a composite—ﬁgure signal. Even so, these are rather minor
compromises, considering how much easier it is to wire the circuit in
Fig. 8-5 into a game system.

Switch Inputs for Figure Positioning

Figure 8-6 is a sketch of a circuit that can be used for entering as
many as 18 position-control bits into either of the circuit boards in
Figs. 8-4 and 8-5. The circuit is drawn speciﬁcally for the circuit in
Fig. 8-4, but it can be interfaced with the simpler circuit in Fig. 8-5 by
omitting the lHP position (89 and R9) and the 256VP position (810
and R10).
