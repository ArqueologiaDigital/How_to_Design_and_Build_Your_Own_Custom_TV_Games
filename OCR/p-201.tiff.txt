directed to the loading inputs of the slipping counter Whenever the
initializing control input is at logic 1.

When the initializing control input is at logic 1, ICl-A is effec-
tively opened so that inverted versions of the slipping—counter reset
pulses emerge from its output. While the initializing control is at logic
1, however, inverter ICZ-A switches that logic level to 0, as far as
the pin-9 input of ICl-C is concerned. ICl-C is thus effectively gated
off, thereby preventing any initializing reset pulses from reaching
ICl-B. Setting the initializing control input to logic 1 blocks any
incoming initializing reset pulses, but allows negative-going
slipping-counter reset pulses to appear at the output of ICl-B.
These pulses are applied to the loading line of the slipping-counter
circuit, letting it operate in its normal, motion-generating mode.

Setting the initializing control input to logic 0 completely
changes the situation. In this case, ICl-A is gated off by the logic—0
level appearing at its pin-2 input, but IC1-C is gated on by virtue of
the logic-1 level now appearing at its pin—9 input. Inverted versions
of the initializing reset pulses thus appear at the output of ICl-B.

In short, the circuit in Fig. 6-11 is simply a digital selector
circuit. It selects one of two sources of reset pulses, depending on
the logic level present at the initializing control input.

Note how this selector circuit is applied to a vertical-slipping
counter in Fig. 6—12. As long as the INTC (initializing-control) input
is at logic 1, IC3—B is gated on, and the normal reset pulses from
ICE—A appear at the output of IC3-C and the load inputs of the
counters. The circuit thus operates in its normal slipping—counter
mode as long as INTC = 1.

Changing INTC to logic 0 gates off IC3-A, however, and deliv-
ers an alternate set of reset pulses to the load inputs of the counters.
These reset pulses at the INTP input generally come from the
Sourcebox unit, so they always occur at some particular vertical
position on the screen. And when these pulses are applied to the
slipping counter, it follows that the counter will be reset at that
particular point on the screen.

There can be no motion effect from the slipping counter as long
as it is being reset from INTP, even if the VC inputs are set for fast
motion in either direction. Motion begins only when INTC is set to
logic 1, thereby allowing the counters to be reset in the normal
fashion from IC3-A.

Why not breadboard the circuit in Fig. 6-12 and try it for
yourself. For the purposes of this experiment, connect VRST from
the Sourcebox through an inverter to the INTP connection.
