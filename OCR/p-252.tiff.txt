the attack missile is in its reset condition, the player can load data
from switches SA and SB into this latch by depressing either the
VELOCITY or DESCENT LOAD pushbuttons.

Depressing the VELOCITY button, for example, feeds the
logic levels from SA and SB into ICE) and through that set of latches to
the 1HC and 2HC outputs. Releasing the VELOCITY button then
latches that 2-bit data in place by allowing the output of ICZ-B to fall
to logic 0.

Depressing the DESCENT button, on the other hand, feeds
the logic levels from SA and SB into 1C9 and to outputs 1VC and
2VC. This data is latched the moment Player B releases the DES
CENT pushbutton.

The entire latch circuit is ﬁxed in its memory mode whenever
the attack missile is launched. Launching the missile feeds a logic-1
level to pin 2 of IC2-A and pin 5 of ICZ-B, placing both halves of the
latch circuit into the memory mode and disabling the effect of the
velocity- and descent-control switches.

Once launched, the attack missile falls at a rate determined by
the data latched at the 1VC and 2VC outputs of 1C9, and it travels
horizontally at a rate determined by the 1HC and 2HC outputs of that
same latch. The initial altitude was originally determined by the
settings of switches SC through SE.

While most of the circuitry in Fig. 7-7 deals with controlling the
operation of the attack missile, there is room on the board for a
couple of other circuits.

1C6 ﬁxes the position and size of the target image, while 1C5
determines the position and size of the attack missile, itself.

The information from these two 8-input NAND gates is effec-
tively AN Ded together in ICZ-D to sense contact between the target
and attack-missile images.

The circuit in Fig. 7-8 is mainly responsible for sensing contact
between the images and taking the appropriate action. ICI-A, for
instance, deﬁnes the right-hand edge of the screen, while ICl-B
deﬁnes the bottom. These two edge-parameters are combined in
IC3-A to yield an active-high (noninverted) deﬁnition of EDGE for
the attack missile. These three ICs are embodied in the block labeled
“edge logic” in Fig. 7-5c. V

IC8-A deﬁnes the top of the screen for the antiballistic missile.
Its active-low (inverted) output is combined withan inverted version
of the AF IG signal in IC4—A to detect contact between the antiballis-
tic missile and the top of the screen.

IC5-A and IC5-C detect contact between the attack missile, the
edge of the screen, and the antiballistic missile, respectively. If.
