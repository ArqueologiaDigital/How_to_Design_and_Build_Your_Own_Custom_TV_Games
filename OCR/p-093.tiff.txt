16 cells in the upper half of the matrix. But notice that it is not
possible to darken any of the extended-matrix cells in the lower half
of the rectangle.

Next, run the 64V source through an inverter to obtain a 64V
signal. Connect that 64V signal to the D inputs of the multiplexer and
note the response on the screen. It turns out that 64V Inputs darken
cells in the lower half of the rectangle, leaving those in the upper half
unaffected. __

Connect various combinations of logic 0, 64V, and 64V to the D
inputs of the multiplexer. Observe the response in each case, and
continue experimenting in this fashion until you are convinced you
understand the behavior of this valuable extended-matrix technique.

The general rules for designing ﬁgures using the extended-
matrix technique go something like this:

- If a cell in the top half of the matrix and its extended
counterpart in the bottom half are to be white, make no
connections to that position on the multiplexer’s D inputs.
