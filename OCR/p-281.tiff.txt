NAND gates ICl—C and ICl-D now see logic-0 levels at one of
their two inputs, thereby guaranteeing logic-1 levels from those two
gates. The output of ICl-B remains at logic 0 because its two inputs
from the latch are still ﬁxed at logic 1.

The EXCLUSIVE OR gates in 1C6 then produce a pattern of
inverted and noninverted H—count signals. IC6-B and IC6-C both
yield inverted versions of their respective H-count inputs, while
IC6—A produces a noninverted version of 128H. Since IC6-D is
permanently wired to invert its 32H input, it follows that the EXC-
LUSIVl_3__(_)R corni___g__guration is producing H—count signals of 256H,
128H, 64H, and 32H. NAN Ding these four signals together in IC4-B
produces a DT image having its horizontal position determined by
the four H-count parameters just described. That’s true if the player
depresses the FIRE 1 button.

The following list summarizes the H-count parameters from
this DT selection circuit whenever the defensive player ﬁres any one
of the four defense torpedoes:

- Sl—m, 128H, (TATE, 37H
~ s2—2—s‘6ﬁ, 1% w 3.211
- 83—256H, 12E, 64H, §_2_§
- S4—256H, 128H, 64H, 32H

The output of 101-3 determines the horizontal position, or to
be more speciﬁc, it determines which one of the four DT ﬁgures are
ﬁred. The output of IC3-B at the vertical-slipping counter then
determines the vertical position of the DT ﬁgure. These two ﬁgure
parameters are ﬁrst transformed into pulses by a set of pulse
generators, then applied to IC7-B where they are molded into the
DT ﬁgure itself. The value of C2 ﬁxes the vertical height of DT,
while C3 sets in width.

The complete DT ﬁgure from IC7-B is inverted by IC7-C and
sent to yet another NOR gate which, in effect, actually functions as a
blanking gate for the DT ﬁgure. Some sort of DT ﬁgure data appears
continuously at pin 3 of IC7-A, but the logic level at pin 2 is deter-
mined by whether the system is in a ﬁring or DT initializing mode.

A NOR gate of this type is effectively switched off whenever
one of its inputs is at logic 1, a condition that occurs whenever the
R-S f lip-ﬂop shows a logic-1 level from pin 6 of ICZ-B. Recall that this
condition signiﬁes the DT ﬁgure is reset to its initial position. The
DT ﬁgures are thus blanked from the screen until they are ﬁred.

The circuit in Fig. 7-17 is basically a ﬁgure generating board.
1C8 generates the target ﬁgure from the selection of H— and V-count
signals shown at its inputs. The ACFIG signal from IC3-A is the
