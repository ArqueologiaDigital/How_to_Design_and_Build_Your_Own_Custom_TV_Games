wide, for example, can appear only in one of six different positions,
the same six positions indicated for black and white 64H bars in Fig.
3-1.

.The circuit in Fig. 8-3b, on the other hand, allows maximum
precision and ﬂexibility as far as positioning a rectangle of any size is
concerned. The whole business of determining the horizontal and
vertical dimensions of the rectangle is taken from the programming
of the comparators and shifted to the values of the capacitors, C1 and
C2. The programming of the comparators ﬁxes the position of the
rectangle with 1H and 1V precision.

While it is difﬁcult to alter the size of a rectangle generated by
the output circuit in Fig. 8—3b, the experimenter (or the game circuit

Fig. 8—3. Combining outputs from horizontal and vertical position programming
circuits. (a) Forming a rather small rectangle figure by effectively ANDing active-
low inputs to a NOR gate. (b) Adjusting the dimensions of igctangle by
selecting capacitor values in a pair of pulse generators. (0) Using Fl-S flip-flops to
extend the dimensions of a comparator-programmed rectangle.
