itself) can have precise control over the position via the comparators’
program inputs. This feature will become especially valuable when
working with ultra-slow-motion controls later in this chapter.

The purpose of the most complex comparator output circuit in
Fig. 8-3c might seem rather obscure at this point, but it is shown

begs for the sake of completeness. The circuit is composed of two
R-S f lip-ﬂops, each having one input taken from a comparator circuit.
The ﬂip—ﬂops are reset by PRST pulses from an external source, and
their outputs are effectively ANDed together by IC2-A.

The ﬂip-ﬂop composed of ICl-A and ICl-B is set to its active
state whenever it sees an HPP pulse from the horizontal-program
comparator. Presumably, the occurrence of this pulse indicates the
starting point of a figure’s horizontal dimension. That particular
ﬂip-ﬂop then remains active until an external HPRST pulse occurs. If
that reset pulse happens to be an inverted version of HRST from the
Sourcebox, the bar begins at the point HPP occurs and ends at the
right-hand side of the screen.

The vertical'portion of this ﬂip-ﬂop circuit, built around ICl-C
and ICl-D, is set in a similar fashion from the VPP signal from a
vertical comparator. It is then reset by an external source such as an
inverted VRST from the Sourcebox. The result in this instance is a
vertical bar that begins when VPP occurs and runs to the bottom of
the screen.

ANDing the outputs of the two ﬂip-ﬂop sections then yields a
rectangular ﬁgure having its upper left—hand corner ﬁxed at a point
where HPP and VPP occur at the same time. If the ﬂip-ﬂops are then
reset as described in the foregoing examples (inverted versions of
HRST and VRST) the ﬁgure extends to the right and bottom of the
screen. Of course it is possible to use alternate sources of HPRST
and VPRST pulses to adjust the position of the ﬁgure’s right and
bottom edges.

This particular circuit will be used for programming the size and
position of complex ﬁgures as described in Chapter 4.

Figure 8-4 is a suggested circuit for a complete pro-
grammable-position—control circuit. 1C1 and 1C2 accept horizontal-
counting and programming information, while 1C3 and 1C4 handle the
vertical programming. The outputs are delivered to pulse
generators where the horizontal dimension of the rectangle is de-
termined by the value of C1 and the vertical dimension by the value
of C2.

The circuit can be assembled on a 40-pin board (Radio Shack
276-153) with plenty of room to spare. The arrangement calls for
using all 40 pins, however.
