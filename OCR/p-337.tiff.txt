TRAVEL TIMER and allows the slipping counter to move the ball in
a direction and at a speed determined by the settings of the player’s
controls. When the ball timing interval is over, the BALL SPEED
CONTROL sets the speed to zero, effectively stopping the ball on
the screen. The ball then moves from that point when the player
depresses the SWING button.

When the ball reaches the green, the BALL 0N GREEN circuit
generates logic levels that both change the color of the ball from
white to black and slow down the ball speed and travel time.

The ball can be putted on the green, presumably toward the
hole. And once the SCORE block senses contact between the ball
and hole, it resets the BALL TRAVEL TIMER to stop ball motion
and lock out the SWING switch. The ball cannot be moved then until
the whole system is reinitialized by depressing the TEE switch.

Circuit Boards for Golf

The golf game described in this chapter requires four circuit
boards: those shown in Figs. 8-18, 8—19, 8-20, and a slipping-counter
board from Fig. 5-15. The functional block diagram in Fig. 8-17 and
the wiring diagram in Fig. 8-22 can be quite helpful for learning about
the circuit boards shown here.

The logic board in Fig. 8-18 includes the program counter, ball
initialization control, ball travel timer, and A/D converter blocks
shown on the functional block diagram.
