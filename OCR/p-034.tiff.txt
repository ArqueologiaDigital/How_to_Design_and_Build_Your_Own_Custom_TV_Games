Fig. 2-8. Vertical blanking and sync waveforms.

The vertical-sync pulse, VSYNC, is generated at IC4-B. This
particular designation does not appear on the schematic, however,
because it is never used alone anywhere else in the system.

IC4-B has an output that remains at logic 1 as long as VBLAN K
is at 0. When VBLANK rises to logic 1, indicating it is time to blank
the vertical retrace on the TV screen, IC4—B allows 4V and an
inverted version of 8V to pass. The result at the output of IC4-B is a
negative-going pulse that begins a count 4V and ends at 8V. This is
the vertical-sync pulse. See the VBLANK and VSYNC pulses illus-
trated in Fig. 2-8.

The remaining circuitry in Fig. 2-7 is responsible for combining
both the horizontal- and vertical—sync and blanking pulses, and then

working the composite sync waveform together with the game
video.

The horizontal— and vertical-sync pulses are effectively com-
bined in the EXCLUSIVE-OR gate, IC7-A. The output of this gate,
shown in Fig. 2-9(a), shows the 15, 7 50-Hz horizontal sync pulses in
a positive-going, active-high format until the vertical-sync pulse
occurs. At that moment, the horizontal pulses switch to an active-
low format, providing the effect of a serrated vertical-sync pulse, an
effect that is necessary for maintaining horizontal sync through
vertical sync and retrace.

IC7-B serves merely as an inverter for obtaining an inverted
version of this composite sync signal.

The horizontal— and vertical-blanking pulses are ORed together
in IC9-C and IC9-D, and then these combined signals are ORed with
the game video in ICQ-B. The output of IC9-B is thus a combination
