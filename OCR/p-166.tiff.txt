Hz framing rate. That adds up to a 2 Hz bandwidth, or a maximum
deviation of 2 Hz out of a possible 61 Hz. (Moving the ﬁgure any
faster than one excursion per second is seldom necessary).

The percentage of change of frequency, then, is on the order of
3%, well within the guaranteed 2% frequency stability of the 556
timer device.

Now suppose you want to use the same kind of circuit for
automatic horizontal control. That means you should build the same
kind of circuit, but using timing values that set the oscillator’s base
frequency at 15,750 Hz, the basic horizontal scan rate.

As in the case of the vertical—motion-control circuit, the time
required for making an excursion across the screen is given by
s = 15, 7 50-f, where f is the oscillator frequency. If 3 turns out to be
a negative number, it means the ﬁgure moves to the left. A positive
value for 5 means the ﬁgure moves to the right. But let’s get to the
point of all this.

If you should want a l-second interval for moving the rectangle
horizontally across the screen, you should be able to vary the
oscillator frequency 1 Hz above or below 15, 750 Hz—between
15,749 Hz and 15,751 Hz. The maximum percentage of change in
this case is only slightly greater than one-tenth of 1%. Unfortunately
the 556 timer and your regulated power supply cannot possibly hold
that kind of tolerance.

Trying to build a horizontal-motion-control circuit around the
scheme in Fig. 5-12 will be a great disappointment. It is virtually
impossible to get a stable ﬁgure on the screen.

It is also difﬁcult to use the circuit in Fig. 5-12 for generating
complex ﬁgures as described in connection with the positioning
controls (Fig. 5-9a, for instance). The problem here is that the
oscillator would have to run at the HRST frequency of about 15, 750
Hz, and we have just gone through the mathematical agony of
showing that the oscillator isn’t stable enough to get smooth control
at that frequency.

Then, too, the vertical speed control does not lend itself to
convenient digital control, the sort of control that is necessary when
the speed and direction of vertical motion is to be determined by the
game circuit, rather than by a player.

The circuit in Fig. 5—12 is thus wholly suitable for player-
controlled motion of simple lines, bars, and rectangles in the vertical
directions. It does not work very well for horizontal motion of any
kind, vertical motion of complex ﬁgures, or vertical motion that is
controlled by the game circuit itself.
