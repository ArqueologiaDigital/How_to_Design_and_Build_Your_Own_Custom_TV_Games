converting it to an unregulated +18 VDC. Transformer T1 steps
down the 120 VAC from the line cord to about 12.6 VAC at its
secondary. The system is fused by F 1, and then the lower AC
voltage is rectiﬁed by a full-wave bridge rectiﬁer assembly, BRL

The +18-V peaks from the bridge circuit are then ﬁltered to an
unregulated 18 VDC by C1 before the voltage is applied to three
+5—V, l-A regulators, VRl through VR3. The DC output from VR1
supplies its regulated 5—V level to circuits within the Sourcebox unit,
including the audio ampliﬁer. This particular +5-V source is also
accessible to the outside for operating relatively low-power circuits.

The regulated outputs from VR2 and VR3 are used only for
powering external game circuits and design breadboards. Some of
the more involved video games described later in this book call for
using all three voltage regulators to their maximum l-A capacity. In
fact any experimenter contemplating designs for very elaborate
games should count on constructing an outboard 5-V regulated
supply capable of providing an additional one or two amps.

The rf modulator assembly, described in more detail later in this
chapter, uses a separate 1. 5—V AA battery as a power supply. Using
a battery for this particular application ensures a clean, ripple-free
modulated video waveform. For the sake of convenience, the bat-
tery supply for the rf modulator is switched on and off by means of
the same toggle switch that applies 120 VAC to the 5-V power
supply section.

The line cord is fed through the back of the Sourcebox housing,
using a plastic strain relief (Radio Shack 278-1636) to prevent abra-
sion of the insulation and possible strain on the connections to the
switch and power transformer.

Power switch 81 should be mounted at some convenient place
on the front panel of the Sourcebox housing, preferably under the
neon POWER ON indicator lamp.

Power transformer T1 should be mounted on the bottom,
inside surface of the Sourcebox housing. The rectiﬁer assembly,
fuse and fuse holder, and all four ﬁlter capacitors can be mounted to a
small perfboard or custom PC board. This compact power supply
board can then be mounted near the power transformer, using
insulated standoffs to prevent any short-circuit conditions to the
Sourcebox housing.

The 5-V regulator assemblies tend to run a bit hot at times. To
reduce the chances of destroying them by overheating, it is a good
idea to mount them directly to the inside surface of the metal
Sourcebox housing, or to afﬁx a small heat sink to each of them. See
the dimensions for one of the three heat sinks in Fig. 2-3. Similar
