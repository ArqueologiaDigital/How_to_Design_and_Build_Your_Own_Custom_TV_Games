for instance, to begin your study of TV games in the middle of the
book, because each chapter assumes an understanding and some
experience with the ideas presented in all the previous chapters.

Build up the systems one step at a time, performing the
suggested experiments and trying some of your own. Hands-on
experience is the key to designing games of your own, and the only
way to get that kind of experience is by doing the work suggested
here.

LOCATING PARTS

Most of the parts speciﬁed in this book are available from stores
such as Radio Shack. In many instances, Radio Shack part numbers
are speciﬁed for the beneﬁt of experimenters who are not fully

_ acquainted with other sources and substitution procedures.

Not all parts are available from Radio Shack, but it is not difﬁcult
to locate them from the many mail—order houses advertising surplus
in newsstand electronics magazines.

ASSEMBLING THE SYSTEMS

There are few speciﬁc notes in this book concerning the ﬁnal
assembly of game circuits. It is left to the experimenter to devise
clever assemblies of his or her own, thereby removing the limita-
tions on fun and imagination that characterize commercially available
TV game systems.

Of course this approach puts something of an extra burden on
the beginner, but what better way to learn than by doing?
