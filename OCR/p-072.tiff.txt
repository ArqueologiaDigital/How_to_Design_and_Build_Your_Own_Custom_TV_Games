determines the horizontal position of the rectangle or
square, and its horizontal width determines its ﬁnal width.

2. Build a vertical white line or bar as described in Recipe for a
Vertical Line or Bar. The position of this bar or line deter-
mines the vertical position of the rectangle, and its horizon-
tal height ﬁxes the height of the ﬁnal product.

’3. If the 8—input NAND gate is used for building these two
lines or bars, transfer them to simpler NAND gates. A line
or bar requiring four inputs, for example, can be transfer-
red to one section of the dual 4-input NAND gate.

4. Run the outputs of the two sets of NAND gates through
INVERT gates and then to the inputs of a Z-input NAN D
gate.

5. Invert the output of that 2-input NAND gate and apply the
resultant signal to CVID—and presto! There’s the square
or rectangle. This step, incidentally, is responsible for
creating a white square on a black ﬁeld. The situation can
be easily reversed (same square, but black on a white field)
by omitting the ﬁnal inverting operation—take the CVID
from the ouput of the 2—input NAND gate described in
step 4.

Try building some rectangles of your own, specifying a variety
of dimensions and positions on the screen. If you want to make some
very small rectangles, you will ﬁnd the RC line-generating technique
is simpler than the basic NAN D-gate approach.

Sculpturing Rectangles

There is an alternate procedure for building a rectangle that
sometimes saves some time and is perhaps more fun to use. First
build the basic rectangle circuit shown in Fig. 3-18, but without
specifying the exact horizontal— and vertical-count inputs. The
screen should be completely white at this point in the procedure, and
it is convenient to assume the circuit is generating a full-screen white
rectangle.

Next, apply a 256H or 256H signal to one input of IC2-A. The
full-screen rectangle will narrow in from one side or the other,
depending on the phase of the 256H signal you use. Then apply a
128V or 128V signal to one input of ICZ-B, and the white rectangle
will shrink down from the top or bottom, again, depending on the
phase of the 128V signal you use.

Then apply an inverted or noninverted 128H signal to another
input of ICZ—A and watch the rectangle narrow even more. Apply a
