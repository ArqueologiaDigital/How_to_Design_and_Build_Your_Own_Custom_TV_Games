portion for the antiballistic missile, Player A. Player B’s control
circuitry is blocked out in Fig. 7 -5b. The overall game control
scheme is shown in Fig. 7-5c.

Referring to the block diagram in Fig. 7-5a, assume the antibal-
listic missile is in its reset condition, resting at the bottom of the
screen. TthLAUNCH signal is in a logic-1 condition at this time
and the R-Siflip-flop is allowing two things to happen. First, it is
enabling the horizontal position logic circuit so that Player A can
manually adjust the horizontal position of his missile via the switches
on his control panel. Second, the reset ﬂip-ﬂop is in a condition
Where the initialization-control circuit is feeding VRST pulses to the
vertical-slipping counter. The signiﬁcance of this latter condition is
that the slipping counter is synchronized to the vertical-counting
system in the Sourcebox. There is no vertical motion of the antibal-
listic missile.

’1 m. 0,. ﬁgure logic block is responsible for combining the antibal-
listic missile’s'nmi'... val data (from the horizontal-position logic
block) and its vertical data (from the VM outputs of the slipping
counter) to create the image _o_1_1_tl_1e screen. The antiballistic missile’s
ﬁgure signal is designated AF IG in Fig. 753.

As long as the antiballisu'c missile is in its reset condition, then,
it cannot move in a vertical direction because its vertical slipping
counter is synchronized to the 60-Hz VRST signal from the Sour-
cebox, but it can be manually moved in the horizontal direction by the
control panel and horizontal-position logic circuit.

Player A launches the antiballisﬁc missile by depressing his
LAUNCH pushbutton. This action generates a brief negative-going
pulse at ALAUNCH, setting the R-S flip-ﬂop to its launch mode.
Two things happen then: The horizontal-position logic is locked out
so that the player no longer has control over the missile’s horizontal
position, and the initialization-control circuit is set to allow the
slipping-counter action to take place. The antiballistic missile thus
rises from the bottom of the screen at a rate determined by the VC
programming of the vertical-slipping counter. (The programming for
this counter is not shown in Fig. 7-Sa because it is internally ﬁxed at a
relatively fast rate).

All of the circuits blocked out inﬁig_ 7 -5a can be found in earlier
chapters of this book. Look for the R-S f lip-ﬂop, horizontal-position
logic, and initialization-control circuits in Chapter 6. The vertical-
slipping counter is found in Chapter 5, and the ﬁgure logic is a simple
variation of the basic ﬁgure-generating circuits in Chapter 3.

Figure 7-5b outlines the main control circuits for the attack
missile. This system includes elements that are nearly identical to
