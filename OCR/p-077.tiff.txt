Whether you use the NAN D-gate squares or EXCLUSIVE-0R
checkerboard, the pattern becomes Ô¨Åner as the input signals de-
crease in order. A 32H, 32V checkerboard pattern, for instance, is
much more coarse than one generated from 8H, 8V inputs.

Checkerboards within checkerboards, checkerboards within
squares, squares within checkerboards, and so on make some fas-
cinating images on the screen. Many of them are potentially useful
for special effects in TV games you will want to develop later on.
