Scoring the Pinball Game

The scoring portion of the pinball game consists of four
7-segment digits. One digit is located near the upper left-hand
corner of the screen to designate which one of ﬁve balls is in play at
the moment. A complete game consists of playing ﬁve balls which is,
of course, the number used for conventional electromechanical pin-
ball games.

Three other ﬁgures, located near the upper right-hand side of
the screen, indicate the score. Scoring in this case can run anywhere
between 000 and 999.

The ﬁgure-generating scheme for the ball counter and scoring
is a variation of the 2-player scoring system described in Chapter 9
(the dual 2-digit display). The only difference is that the digits are
grouped differently.

Figure 10-10 shows the numeral format, required waveforms,
and programming. The circuit based on this rationale is in Fig. 10-11.
Since this whole scheme is practically identical to the one already
detailed in Fig. 9-7, it is left to the reader to sort out the ﬁner details.

While the score-ﬁgure board in Fig. 10-11 requires little addi-
tional explanation, the score-control board (Fig. 10—12) calls for
some special discussion.

This counting-control board is responsible for keeping track of
which ball is in play and the total score at any given moment. Of
special interest is the section of the circuit labeled WEIGHTED
SCORE CIRCUIT. This pinball game, like its electromechanical
counterparts, scores different amounts according to the type of
contact the ball makes with various ﬁgures in the playing area. ,

The scores in this case can be 1, 2, or 4 points per contact. The
origins of the weighted—scoring inputs is described in detail when we
get to the theory of the main control board. For the time being, it is
sufﬁcient to say that the three scoring digits—those generated by
1C6, 1C7, and IC8—increment 1, 2, or 4 units whenever certain ball
contacts occur. The theory behind the weighted scoring is described
in connection with the circuit in Fig. 9-11.

1C5 in Fig. 10-12 is the ball counter. This counter is in-
cremented by a BCOUNT pulse, which occurs each time the player
depresses the BALL pushbutton. When the count reaches binary 5,
ICQ—A generates a logic-0 level the signals the end of the game (the
TENT) output).

The ball and score counters are all reset to zero by a pulse from
IC9—D, a pulse that occurs whenever the player depresses the PLAY
pushbutton.
