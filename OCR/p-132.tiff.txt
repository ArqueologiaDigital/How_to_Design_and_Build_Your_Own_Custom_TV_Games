tions for doing this particular windowing job. Note that the smallest
H-count window input is one step larger than the largest H-count
speciﬁcation used for generating the ﬁgure. To be more speciﬁc, the
ﬁgure—generating multiplexer circuit uses H—count inputs 4H, 8H,
and 16H. The next larger H-count signal, 32H, is thus just large
enough to cover the racing car ﬁgure.

By the same token, the V-count windowing should begin with
the V~count signal that is one step larger than the largest V-count
used for generating ﬁgure. The largest V-count for the ﬁgure in this
instance is 16V, the extension inputs to the D connections. The 32V
signal is thus the appropriate one for windowing the images horizon-
tally.

The ﬁ_eld_ of cars can be limited to one part of the screen by
including 256H and 128H at the windowing inputs. The two addi—
tional windowing inputs restrict the ﬁeld of cars to a vertical “race
track” situated just left of center.

A general rule for windowing complex ﬁgures is emerging from
this discussion. Always begin windowing, using H- and V-count
signals one step higher than the largest used for generating the basic
ﬁgure.

If the basic ﬁgure is built within a 4 x8 matrix, for example, and
the largest H- and V-count signals used for generating that ﬁgure are
4H and 8V respectively, the windowing should begin with 8H and
16V.

Windowing for irregular Patterns of identical Figures

While the notion of windowing a basic complex figure to get a
particular pattern of rows and columns serves some useful purposes
