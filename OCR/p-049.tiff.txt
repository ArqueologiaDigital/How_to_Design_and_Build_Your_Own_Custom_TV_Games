inverter ﬁrst. The inputs to the N AN D gate are now 256H and 128H.
How has this inversion of the 1281-1 signal inﬂuenced the pattern on
the screen?

The white portion of the 256H signal is cut in two by a white/
black alternation this time. Recall that connecting a noninverted
version of 128H to the NAN D gate also cut the white portion of the
256H image in two, but with a black-to-white alternation.

Continue adding inverted versions of the H-count signals to the
NAND gate until all eight inputs are used. If __y__ou are adding these
inputs in decreasing order—from 128H to 64H, to 32H, to 16H,
etc. —you will see that the white bar on the screen narrows in from
the right-hand side. V

As far as the line-building effect on the TV screen is concerned,
adding a noninverted version of the next-lower-order H input nar-
