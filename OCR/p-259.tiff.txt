edge of the screen, about halfway between the top and bottom. The
attack player has no control over the reset position and timing.

Now suppose the defensive player launches a defense torpedo.
Once launched, a defense torpedo continues its rather rapid upward
motion until one of two events occur: the DT strikes the attack craft
(DT=AC) or the DT images reaches the top of the screen
(DT=TOP). In either case, the DT image is reset immediately and
the defensive player is ready to launch another one.

Figure 7-10b is the flow chart for the attack torpedo. One of two
things must happen after the aggressor launches a torpedo. The
torpedo can strike the target (AT=TARG), causing the target image
to ﬂash and then returning the torpedo to the attack craft. The other
thing that can happen after launching the attack torpedo is that it
misses the target and moves to the top, bottom, or right-hand edge
of the screen. These three edges, designated EDGEZ, represent
the limits of the ATS travel. Hitting any one of them immediately
resets the position of the AT to the attack craft. There is no score for
either player.

Torpedo Attack Game Panels

Figure 7 -11 shows the general layout of the two control panels
for the Torpedo Attack game. The panel for the DT player consists
of four pushbuttons switches, labeled 1 through 4, that launch
defense torpedoes. The numerals represent the four torpedoes
located in the relative positions indicated in Fig. 7-10c.

The defense player can launch any one of the torpedoes at any
time and in any sequence. But a launched torpedo must complete its
cycle (either hitting the top of the screen or the attack craft) before
another can be launched. .

The control panel for the attack player, Fig. 7—11b, includes a
pair of controls for steering the attack craft and a FIRE pushbutton
for launching the attack torpedo. The attack player can control the
motion of his craft as indicated by the arrows on the control panel. A
serious experimenter might want to replace the two AC motion
controls with a single two-dimensional joystick control, thereby
making the steering and ﬁring operations somewhat less awkward.

Potentiometer Control of Speed and Direction

All of the slipping-counter speed and direction controls de—
scribed thus far call for inserting a 4-bit binary number that deter—
mines the direction and speed of the apparent motion. The Missile
Attack II game, for example, lets the player controlling the attack
