requires two address lines. The frame addresses, designated B1 and
B0, determine which one of the four frames will appear on the screen
at any given moment. When B1=BO=0, for example, the ﬁrst frame
should appear on the screen. Then when B1=0 and BO=0, the
second frame should appear, and so on through the sequence. If this
2-bit counting sequence is taken from a binary counter circuit, the
sequencing will take place automatically, thereby generating the
desired animation effect.

The table in Fig. 11-33 shows a complete breakdown of frames
1 and 2 in terms of the data inputs required for an 8 x 8 extended
matrix generator circuit. The procedure for determining the data
requirements is identical to that described in connection with the
basic 8 X 8 extended matrix in Fig. 4-18. The “X” in this case
