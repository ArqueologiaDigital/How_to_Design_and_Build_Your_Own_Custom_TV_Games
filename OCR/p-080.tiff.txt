as part of the discussions in this chapter can be modiﬁed at a later
time so that they can be moved freely around the screen. Keep a
good set of notes concerning the speciﬁcations for interesting and
potentially useful ﬁgures. Such notes will prove invaluable when you
decide to work out a TV game of your own.

COMPLEX-FIGURE TINKERBOX

Assemble a Tinkerbox assembly similar to the one described in
Chapter 3 for building lines, bars, and rectangles. As indicated in the
parts list in Fig. 4—1, you need at least one 7450 16: 1 multiplexer and
a 7486 quad EXCLUSIVE-OR in addition to the inverters and NAN D
gates prescribed for the Line/Bar Tinkerbox. There will be a need
for as many as four 7450 multiplexers for performing the more
advanced experiments in this chapter. But since these large 24-pin
ICs take up so much space on the breadboard, it is a good idea to
attach them to the board only as they are needed.
