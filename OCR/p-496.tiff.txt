level for a period of time determined by the product of 1.1 times the
values of R3 and C2.

Setting the pin—3 output of the 555 to logic 1 in this fashion opens
the 2—input NAN D gate, allowing the 4V signal to pass through to the
audio ampliﬁer in the Sourcebox unit. The player thus hears a 1973-
Hz tone which, in this particular case, lasts about 110 ms. The sound
is very much like that of a table-tennis ball hitting a paddle.

Of course the tone duration can be modiﬁed by altering the
values of R3 and C2, and the tone frequency can be changed by
selecting a different V-count input.

The circuit is perfectly compatible with any of the video games
that include a ﬁgure-contact operation. Most of these operations
generate a negative-going pulse that can be connected to the timer
through C1. R1 and S can be normally omitted in such cases.

This circuit can also be connected to the SWING pushbutton on
the Golf game (Chapter 8). The effect is a “plink” sound every time
the player hits the ball.

Connect this circuit to the HIT terminal in the Pinball game
(Chapter 10), and you will hear the “plink” sound every time the ball
rebounds from one of the barriers or paddles.

It is sometimes desirable to generate more than one “plink”
frequency in a game. Suppose, for example, you want two different
sounds of this sort, each switched on by a different event on the
screen. Figure 12-3 shows how this can be done.

Basically, the circuit ORs together the tones from the two
“plink” circuits. The occurrence of event A switches on IC l-A, and
allows the 4V frequency to pass through IC2—A and ICZ-B to the
audio ampliﬁer in the Sourcebox unit. By the same token, the
occurrence of event B switches ICl-B to its active state, allowing
the 8V frequency to pass to the audio ampliﬁer.
