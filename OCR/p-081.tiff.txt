For the sake of readers who have no special knowledge of
digital electronics, the operation of the 16: 1 multiplexer circuit calls
for'some special consideration. The truth table in Fig. 4-2 repre-
sents the operation of a 74150 16:1 multiplexer IC. Note that the
device has 16 separate data in_p_uts, labeled D0 through D15. There
is a single output, however, M. Then notice thergare four select
inputs, SO through S3, and a chip-enable input, CE. All of those
terminals, plus two more for +5V and COMM, add up to 24 pins.

» According to the truth table ﬂig. 4-2, the M output of this IC
is always at logic 1 whenever the CE input is at logic 1. The X_s_i_n the
select _<_:91umns mean those inputs are not relevant as long as CE=1.

' The CE input, in effect, is capable of disablingthe chip altogether—
as long as CE=1, to be speciﬁc. Setting the CE input to logic 0 thus
enables the IC fogﬁ normal multiplexing operations.

Suppose the CE input is set to logic 0. Whenever that is the
case, output M is equal to an inverted version of one of the 16 D
inputs. Furthermore, the D input that appears inverted at the M
output depends on the status of the select inputs. If the select inputs
are all set to logic 0, for instance, an inverted version of input DO
