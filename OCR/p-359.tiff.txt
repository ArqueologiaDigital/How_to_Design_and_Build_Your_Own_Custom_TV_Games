All that remains to be discussed is the way the bad guy knows

hevis lined up with the good guy so he can ﬁre a shot. IC1-C senses
the alignment of the two opposing ﬁgures and generates a negative—
going pulse that initiates monostable timer IC7-A. This particular
timer is set for 0.1 second. And at the end of that time, a second
0.1-second timer (IC7-B) is initiated.
,. IC1—C senses alignment of the two ﬁgures on the screen, IC7—A
inserts a O. 1—second delay, and IC7-B is responsible for making the
bad guy ﬁre a shot. ICl-D in Fig. 8-26 normally shows a ﬁxed logic-1
output, but if the bad guy ﬁres while he is Mp with the good guy,
ICl—D senses this fact and generates a GHIToutput.

Recall that a GHITpulse resets the entire game system,
making it impossible for the good guy to ﬁre another round until the
player depresses the START pushbutton. Without the 0.1-second
delay inserted by 1C7 -A, the good guy wouldn’t stand a chance of
shooting anyone.

 

Ambush Wiring Diagram

The wiring diagram in Fig. 8—27 indicates this is a rather simple
and inexpensive game to set up. The only calibration adjustment is
ﬁxing the value of R13 in Fig. 8-25. This trimpot works with the
MOVE control to set the range of motion of the good-guy ﬁgure.

'R13 should be adjusted so that moving the MOVE control
between its two extremes moves the good—guy ﬁgure to the top and
bottom of the screen.

The ﬁgure board should be operated from one of the +5V
supplies, while the control board and panel can take their supply
voltage from the second source.

STORMTROOPER ATTACK

You are the sole defender of a spacecraft. Eight enemy
stormtroopers begin slowly advancing on your position, and you are
all armed with deadly ray—gun weapons. You must defend your
position, Wiping out all eight stormtroopers before they reach your
position.

The screen diagram in Fig. 8—28 shows the initial formation for
this Stormtrooper game. You, the good guy, are located at the
bottom of the screen, and your motion is limited to that part of the
screen. The eight stormtroopers move straight down the screen
toward you at the rate of about one—screen—per-71 seconds. In other
words, you have only about 60 seconds to kill them off.

The control panel includes a MOVE control that lets the player
move the good guy back and forth along the bottom of the screen, a
