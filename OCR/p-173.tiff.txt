The circuit in Fig. 5-14 represents the basic horizontal-slipping
counter. It is, indeed, the only horizontal-motion circuit used
throughout this book.

ICs 1, 2, 3 and 5 in Fig. 5-14 perform the same general function
as the vertical-slippng counter in Fig. 5-13. They are responsible for
counting out a horizontal-count cycle of nine bits, four bits each for
ICl and IC2, and a ninth bit from the J-K ﬂip-ﬂop, 1C5.

The 3-input NAN D gate, ICS-A, senses the counter overﬂow of
111111111, or decimal 511. The starting point for the stop code in
this case is binary 10010010, or decimal 137. Take the difference
between these 2 ﬁgures and you end up with a counting cycle that is
374 pulses long. That is the number of pulses required for making a
horizontally movable ﬁgures appear motionless on the screen.

An astute reader, however, might note that this number is quite
different from the counting cycle of the horizontal-count generator in
the Sourcebox unit. Recall that the Sourcebox generates a 454—pulse
horizontal cycle.

The answer to this particular situation concerns the fact that
HBLANK is applied to the enable input of ICl in Fig. 5-14. The
occurrence of this positive pulse disables the horizontal-slipping
counter at the end of each scan line—for 80 HCLK pulses. So if you
drop those 80 HCLK pulses from the Sourcebox interval, you end up
with 374 HCLK pulses that occur while the horizontal lines are
visible on the screen. That is the same number of pulses that emerge
each cycle from the slipping counter set for a motionless ﬁgure.

Any ﬁgure having its horizontal components generated by the
horizontal-slipping counter thus appears motionless on the screen as
long as that counter is being loaded with a 374 HCLK cycle.

Now notice from Fig. 5-14 that the ﬁve higher-order bits are
always loaded as 01000. The clearing input of IC3-A and the preset
inputs of 1C2 are always ﬁxed for loading those values, no matter
what the motion code might be.

The peculiar feature of the horizontal-slipping counter is that
the stop code—the four lower order bits loaded at the preset inputs
of ICI—must be loaded at the end of each horizontal cycle. If
something other than the stop code is loaded each cycle, the circuit
generates moving diagonal lines rather than moving, straight vertical
lines.

A motion code other than the stop code is loaded only during
one particular scan line that occurs during vertical retrace on the
screen. 1C4 and 1C6 in Fig. 5—14 take care of this situation.
