The ball—blanking ﬂip-ﬂop is reset only when the ball crosses BE
(the bottom edge of the playing area) while traveling downward.
This effect is detected by the pin—9 output of 1C7, the same one
responsible for resetting the entire game at the end of play for the
ﬁfth ball.

Overall Pinball Block Diagram

A ﬁnal wiring diagram for the pinball game appears in Fig.
10-15. You will note that the game requires ﬁve circuit boards and a
special control panel. Of course you should already have the
slippingocounter board available from previous experiments and
games.

The slipping counter and control boards can be powered from
one of the +5V sources, while the remaining boards ought to be
connected to a second source to avoid overloading any one of the
power supplies.
