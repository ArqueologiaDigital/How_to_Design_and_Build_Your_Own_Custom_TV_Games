of horizontal— and vertical-blanking pulses and any game video
applied from external circuitry to IC9—A.

These two sets of waveforms—the composite sync from 1C7 -B
and video and blanking pulses—are ﬁnally amplitude modulated at
the 3-state buffer, IC8-A. A precise analysis of this operation is left
to experimenters who have some experience with Boolean algebra.
The overall effect, however, is shown in Fig. 2-9(b).

The composite video waveform in Fig. 2-9(b) clearly shows
three distinct voltage levels. The highest voltage level, about +5V,
is the domain of the blacker-than-black sync pulses. At the other
extreme is the white-video information, at about 0V. Black-video
information and the blanking pulses fall between these two ex-
tremes, occuring only when the 3-state buffer is put into its high-
impedance state by the output of IC6-D.

The vertical— count and composite-video board in Fig. 2-7 can
be assembled on the same kind of 44-pin edge card that the horizon-
tal section is. Both boards should be situated in their respective
edge-card connectors in the Sourcebox housing.
