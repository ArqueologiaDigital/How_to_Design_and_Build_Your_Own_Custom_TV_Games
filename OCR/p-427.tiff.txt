The ﬁxed rebound barriers are labeled A through F, and are
arranged in a symmetrical pattern about the vertical axis of the
playing area.

PL and PR are the player’s left and right paddles as they appear
in their normal resting positions. The dashed ﬁgures labeled PL’ and
PR’ indicate the same paddles as they appear when the player
depresses the PADDLE pushbutton on the control panel. '

This entire ﬁgure—the four edges, fixed barriers, and
paddles—is generated by an 8 X 8 extended foldover-matrix
generator of the type described in Chapter 4. The extension in this
case is from top to bottom, While the foldover is around the vertical
axis. Note, for instance, that the right—hand half of the ﬁgure is a
mirror image of the left-hand half. The data programming for the
matrix generator refers to the upper left-hand quadrant, and the
remainder of the ﬁgure comes about by extension and foldover.
