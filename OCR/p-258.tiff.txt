torpedo by depressing a FIRE pushbutton, the attack torpedo is free
to move along the path that the attack craft was following at the time.
The AC player must head directly toward the target, ﬁre his tor-
pedo, and then pull away from the target before colliding with it. The
launched torpedo follows the original path to the target.

While the defensive player can, indeed, destroy the attack craft
with a defense torpedo, he cannot destroy the attack torpedo after it
has been ﬁred. {

Figure 7 - 10c shows the four different images that can appear on
the screen at any given moment: DT (defense torpedo), AC (attack
craft), AT (attack torpedo), and the target.

The defense torpedoes can be launched at any time along the
paths shown by dashed lines. The attack craft can be moved in any
direction and at any speed within the Viewing area, carrying the
attack torpedo until it is launched by the aggressor. The attack craft
is free to move through the left- and right-hand edges of the screen,
but it “crashes” if it touches the top or bottom. The dotted lines in
Fig. 7-10c indicate one particular AC attack run.

The aggressor has full control over the attack craft except when
one of three reset conditions occur. According to the ﬂowchart in
Fig. 7-10a, the attack craft is automatically reset (and destroyed)
when AC=EDGE1, AC=TARG, or DT=AC. Translating these
choice—point operations into plain English, DT=AC means one of the
defense torpedoes strikes the attack craft, a score in favor of the
defensive player.

AC=TARG means the attack craft itself collides with the target
image. This represents a draw or a score for the defensive player,
depending on whether or not the attack torpedo is still on board the
attack craft. If the torpedo is still on board the attack craft when the
latter collides with the target, both the target and attack craft are
destroyed, a draw sequence. If the torpedo has been launched when
the attack craft collides with the target, however, only the attack
craft is destroyed. Another point for the defensive player.

AC=EDGE1 is a condition where the aggressor steers the
attack craft too high or low on the screen. The attack craft must
remain between the top and bottom of the screen. Touching either of
these two boundaries destroys the attack craft and represents a
default score for the defensive player.

So according to Fig. 7-10a, the attack craft is ﬂashed on and off,
and reset to a starting position whenever it is hit by one of the
defense torpedoes, hits the top or bottom of the screen, or collides
with the target. The AC reset position, by the way, is at the left-hand
