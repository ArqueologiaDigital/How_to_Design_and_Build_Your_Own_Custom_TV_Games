determining the size and position of the ﬁgure. In a manner of
speaking, it is a programmable-ﬁgure size and position control.

The circuit in Fig. 8-2 shows a complete ﬁgure-programming
circuit for either the horizontal or vertical parameters for ﬁxing the
position and size of a line/bar ﬁgure on the screen.

The circuit has two sets of inputs. The inputs labeled 1, 2, 4. . . ,
256 go to their respective connections from the H— or V—count
terminals of the Sourcebox unit. If the circuit is being used to
generate horizontal parameters, for example, input 1 goes to 1H,
input 2 goes to 2H, and so on.

A second set of nine inputs labeled 1P through 256P generally
go to ﬁxed 1 or O logic levels.

These inputs are continuously compared in 1C1, 1C2, and
IC4-A. 1C1 compares the four lower-order bits, and when they are
equal, it delivers an A=B logic level to IC2 where the 16, 32, 64, and
128 bits are compared. If the ﬁrst eight pairs of inputs are equal, 1C2
then generates an A=B output from its pin—6 connection.

1C1 and 1C2 are 4-bit magnitude comparators that are cascaded
to perform 8-bit comparison. The two IC’s compare the eight
lower—order H- or V-count signals with the eight corresponding logic
levels at the P inputs. IC4-A, in conjunction with an inverter function
at IC4-B, make up a 1-bit magnitude comparator for the 256 bit. If
the 256 bit from the Sourcebox is the same as the 1 or 0 logic level at
the 256P input, the output of IC4-B goes to logic 1.

IC3—A thus sees two comparison signals. If all eight of the
lower-order bits are equal and the 265-bit inputs are equal, IC3-A
generates a logic-0 level as long as that condition exists.

Putting this information all together, the circuit in Fig. 8-2a
works as a 9-bit magnitude comparator, generating a logic-0 output
only when the signals from the Sourcebox have logic levels that are
identical to those set at the nine P inputs.

Use the circuit in Fig. 8—23 as the basis of an experiment with
the magnitude comparator scheme. Connect the Sourcebox inputs
to the H-count signals and make provisions for either grounding or
connecting the P inputs to +5V. If the PP output is connected
directly to the GAME VID IN connection on the Sourcebox, you will
be working with a ﬁne, black horizontal line on a white background.
Running PP through another inverter before applying the signal to
Sourcebox will generate a white line on a black ﬁeld.

In any event, you will ﬁnd you are working with a vertical line
that is 1H wide. To get the experiment started, connect the P inputs
to the following pattern of Is (+5V or no connection at all) and Os
(ground connection): 100001010, where the bit on the left is the
