As described thus far, the circuit in Fig. 6-17 can serve two
purposes: It can be used for adjusting the position of a ﬁgure on the
screen by means of some programming switches, and it can be used
for programming the initial position of a movable ﬁgure.

Programming Figure Speed and Direction

The circuit for programming the speed and direction of a mova-
ble ﬁgure is somewhat simpler than the one used for programming
initial positions. As indicated in Fig. 6-19a, a set of four SPDT
switches can be connected to the VC or HC inputs of a slipping
counter. The appropriate motion codes are listed in the tables in
Figs. 5-13 and 5-14. All this simple switch circuit does is allow the
player to adjust those codes manually.

As an example, suppose you want to be able to adjust the
vertical speed and direction of a movable ﬁgure. The vertical compo-
nent of that ﬁgure’s motion is generated by a vertical-slipping
counter (Fig. 5-13). Obtaining some control over this motion is a
matter of connecting switches to the VC inputs of that circuit.

If switch A is connected to lVC, switch B to 2VC, and so on, as
illustrated in Fig. 6—19B, the player can set the ﬁgure for a rather fast
downward motion by adjusting the switches for A = 1, B = 0,
C = 1 and D = 0. These settings correspond to the fast-
downward-motion code speciﬁed in Fig. 5—13.

This switch circuit can be used with the basic missile attack
game to give the player a choice of speeds for both the attack and
antiballistic missiles. See the diagram in Fig. 6—19b.

The directions cannot be changed in this particular case. The
direction of the two missiles ought to be ﬁxed so that the attack
missile always moves from left to right and the antiballistic missile
moves upward. Thus 8VC is permanently connected to logic 1 and
8HC is always connected to logic 0. The other three inputs in each
case, however, give one or two players a wide range of speeds—
eight different speeds, to be exact. '

The speed of the antiballistic missile, for example, is prog-
rammable by switches SA, SB, and SC. In a similar fashion, the
attack velocity is adjustable by means of switches SD, SE, and SF.

Incorporating this speed-programming circuit into the missile-
attack game is a matter of making the switch connections designated
in Fig. 6-19b to the corresponding VC and HC slipping counter inputs
shown in the insert in Fig. 6-16.

If you have been following these discussions carefully, you
ought to be getting at least a mental impression of some incredibly
