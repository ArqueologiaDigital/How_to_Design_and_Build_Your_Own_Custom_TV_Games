plug-in game modules and the so-called tinkerboxes
(breadboard units intended for se1f~learning experiments
and game design). With the notable exception of the
+1.5-V supply voltage for the rf modulator, the power
supply gets its power from a standard 120-VAC, 60-1-12
source.

2. 7-MHz oscillator—This is the master clock oscillator for
the entire TV game system. For best results, this should
be a crystal-controlled, 14-MHz oscillator, followed by a
toggling ﬂip-ﬂop that both divides the crystal frequency by
two and assures a clean, 7-MHz HCLK waveform.

3. Horizontal-count source—The horizontal-count source

’ generates a 9-bit binary counting code that divides the
game screen into 455 equal horizontal segments. Each
horizontal scan line on the screen is thus divided into 455
discrete sections, each of which is capable of rendering one
bit of horizontal video information.

The nine binary—counting outputs are labeled 1H, 2H,
4H, 8H, and so on through 256H, with 1H being the
least-significant (highest-frequency) output and 256H
being the most—signiﬁcant output bit.

The horizontal-count source also generates an HRST
(Horizontal ReSeT) pulse that is used for clocking the
vertical-count source and synchronizing the operation of
some game circuits. An inverted version of this positive-
going HRST pulse, designated HRST, is used for generat-
ing horizontal-sync pulses.

4. Horizontal sync and blanking generator—The inverted
HRST pulse from the horizontal-count source is converted
to horizontal sync and blanking pulses in this part of the
Sourcebox unit. The horizontal-sync pulse (HSYNC) ulti-
mately triggers the TVs horizontal retrace operation. The
horizontal-blanking pulse (HBLANK) is likewise used for
blanking horizontal retrace on the TV screen and for cer-
tain kinds of control operations for the video games.

5. Vertical-count source—The vertical-count circuit is almost
identical to its horizontal counterpart. It generates a 9-bit
binary count that divides the receiver’s raster into 262
vertical segments, or lines. In a manner of speaking, this
circuit provides information regarding the position of the
TV’s beam in the vertical sense.

Like the horizontal-count source, the nine outputs are
labeled 1V through 256V, with IV being the least-
