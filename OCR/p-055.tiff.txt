 

Creating intersecting parallel lines, both horizontal and vertical,
is a simple matter of extending the Tinkerbox techniques already
described in this chapter. First build the lines one at a time, using the
8—input NAN D gate and inverter system. Keep track of the “formu-
la” for each line, then reduce them to simpler NAN D-gate inputs.

Next combine the vertical lines as shown in Fig. 3-6, and then
combine the two horizontal lines in the same fashion. All that remains
to be done at that point is to combine the two sets of parallel lines into
one image. Figure 3—7 shows how this can be done.

Figure 3-7a shows the most straightforward technique for
combining pairs of horizontal and vertical parallel lines. The idea is to
build the horizontal and vertical parallel lines separately as described
in the previous section of this chapter. Then combine the two sets of
lines by ﬁrst inverting them and then applying them to separate
inputs of a 2-input NAN D gate. The output of that ﬁnal NAN D-gate
stage yields the composite image.

While this might be the most straightforward technique, it is not
the most efﬁcient. It is possible to do the same job using the circuit in
Fig. 3-7b. '

To understand how the circuit in Fig. 3-7b works, let’s assume
you have used the recipes for vertical and horizontal lines to get the
line-generating speciﬁcations—~the combinations of inverted and
noninverted count inputs for each of the four lines. After reducing
these input speciﬁcations to the point where you are using the
simplest possible input NAND gates for each line, simply connect
the outputs of the four NAND gates to a 4-input NAND gate. You will
ﬁnd that the output of that ﬁnal NAND-gate circuit creates an image
identical to the output of the more complicated looking circuit in Fig.

In fact it is possible to use the general circuit in Fig. 3—7b to
combine any number of different lines on the screen. Simply build the
horizontal and vertical lines separately, reduce the input NAN D gate
circuits to their simplest form, and then connect the outputs of each
of the line-generating NAND gates to an output NAN D gate. If the
output NAN D gate happens to be a 7430 8-input NAND gate, it is
possible to combine as many as eight different combinations of
horizontal and vertical lines into one image.

The circuits in Fig. 3-8 show the author’s circuits for generating
the tic-tac-toe pattern and a full-screen border for many different
kinds of video games. The circuits are essentially identical, the only
difference being the spacing of the pairs of horizontal and vertical
parallel lines. Of course it is possible to create the same patterns, but
