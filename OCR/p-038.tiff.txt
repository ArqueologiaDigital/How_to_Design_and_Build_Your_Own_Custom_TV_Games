about $10, the job of building one from scratch is hardly worth the
trouble.

Suitable modulators are now being used by microprocessor
enthusiasts who want to interface their computer systems with a TV
display. 80 the best source of modulators is the amateur computer
shops now springing up all over the country. At the time of this
writing, Radio Shack is planning to offer a suitable modulator in the
near future. Although it is intended speciﬁcally for use with that
company’s microprocessor system, it would serve our purposes
quite well.

Mount the modulator inside the Sourcebox unit, as far as
possible from the master clock and crystal (to avoid possible rf
interference between the two).

SOME MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS

All of the Sourcebox circuitry ﬁts quite nicely into Radio Shack’s
“compact” 57/s-by 9- by His-inch cabinet (Radio Shack 270-281). See
Fig. 2-10.

The two major circuit boards can be inserted into 44-pin edge-
card connectors mounted vertically on the inside rear surface of the
cabinet. The rf modulator is likewise mounted on that surface, using
a 2-terminal, feedthrough TV antenna connector (Radio Shack 274-
663). The power supply components are mounted inside the cabinet
as described earlier in this chapter.

What has not been adequately described thus far is the means
for getting access to the horizontal- and vertical-counting signals as
well as any other system inputs and outputs that are vital to the
operation of game systems. The most convenient way to interface
the Sourcebox with the outside world is by means of another 44-pin
edge-card connector that feeds through the back of the cabinet.

All of the connections between the Sourcebox and outside
world are made through this connector. Its solder connections are
inside the cabinet, connected to the appropriate signal sources as
suggested in Fig. 2-11. Getting access to these signals from the
outside world is thus a simple matter of plugging the appropriate 4-
by 4—inch 44-pin PC card into the plug on the back of the cabinet.

No matter how you choose to arrange the circuitry for the
Sourcebox unit, bear in mind that you must have convenient access
to the supply voltages and signal connections listed in Fig. 2-11.
