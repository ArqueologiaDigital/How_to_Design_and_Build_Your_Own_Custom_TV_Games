vertical-count signals 1V, 2V, 4V, and 8V. Of course +5V and
COMM should be included on this list.

The control inputs are lHC, ZHC, 4HC, and BBC for horizontal
motion, and WC, 2VC, 4VC, and 8VC for vertical motion. The
motion-control codes for these two sets of inputs are included in
Figs. 5-14 and 5-13 respectively.

The slipping-counter outputs are designated lHM through
256HM for horizontal counting, and IVM through 128VM for verti-
cal counting. These outputs can be used for generating lines, bars,
rectangles, and complex ﬁgures, as described in Chapters 3 and 4.
Merely substitute the HM signals for H-count speciﬁcations and VM
signals for the corresponding V-count speciﬁcations.

The scheme is left programmable to some extent. The idea
here is to give the experimenter the greatest possible amount of
ﬂexibility with this one circuit board. To operate the system in the
normal fashion, merely connect the HMRST output to BEE, and
VHRST to WE. (Leaving these points “programmable” allows the
experimenter to insert other kinds of reset circuits that initialize the
position of the movable ﬁgure.)
