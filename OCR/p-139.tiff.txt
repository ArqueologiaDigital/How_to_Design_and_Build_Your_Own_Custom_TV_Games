MOTION-CONTROL TINKERBOX

If you have been performing the experiments outlined in Chap-
ters 3 and 4, you should have at hand a good assortment of NAND,
NOR, and invert gates. You will need them for the motion-control
Tinkerbox.

In addition, you will need some 555 monostable multivibrators
(timers or the 556 dual timers), a few more 7493 counters such as
those used in the Sourcebox, and some 74191 presettable up—down
binary counters. Study the diagrams in this chapter, making up a list
of ICs you might have to order now.

You will need the timers for performing the experiments in the
ﬁrst part of this chapter, but fortunately, they aren’t difﬁcult to find
these days. You might have to send away for the 74191 counters, but
here you have some lead time because they aren’t required for a
while.

Figure 5-1 shows the pinouts for the 555 and 556 timers and the
74191 counter. Most fo the circuits described in this call for using
556 dual timers. You can, however, substitute two 5555 by making
the changes in pin numbers as indicated on the chart in Fig. 5—1.

The counter in Fig. 5-1a is in its normal counting mode
whenever the ENAB input is at logic 0, the load input, L, is at logic 1,
