6-13b and an inverted VRST from Sourcebox to the VINT input. Of
course the INTC terminal should be grounded to initialize the ﬁgure
and hold it steady while you are building it.

Once the ﬁgure is built to your own satisfaction, set some
motion-control commands to the VC and HC inputs of Fig. 5-15 and
remove INTC from ground. The ﬁgure should then move around the
screen as prescribed by your motion-control inputs.

You should notice that the figure folds over very nicely
whenever it reaches one edge of the screen. If it is moving to the
right, for instance, the front part of the ﬁgure will begin appearing at
the left-hand edge of the screen while the tail end is still moving into
the right-hand edge.

This can be a desirable effect in many instances, but there are
occasions where it is important to “hide” a ﬁgure. Since the slipping
counters are disabled through the horizontal- and verticaLblanking
intervals, ﬁgures cannot be hidden in those spaces. There must be a
way to hide ﬁgures on occasions, especially while they are resting in
their initial positions.

Figure 6-14 shows a rather simple control circuit that blanks a
movable ﬁgure while it is resting in its initial position. You will note a
ﬂip-ﬂop circuit composed of ICl-A and ICl—C. Whenever a
negative-going RESETpulse occurs, the ﬂip-ﬂop is set so that the
output of ICl-A is at logic 0 and the output of ICl-C is at logic 1. In
this reset condition, the slipping counter sees the initializing reset
arriving at the IN TP input. For all intents and purposes, the ﬁgure is
stationary in its initial position. At the same time, however, the
logic-0 level from ICl-A gates off the ﬁgure-generating logic gate
IC2-B. The image of the initialized ﬁgure cannot possibly appear on
the screen.

Applying a negative-going pulse to ICl-A alters the operation,
allowing the slipping counter to run at a rate determined by its
control inputs (not shown in Fig. 6-14) and unblanking the image data
from IC2-B.

Any ﬁgure generated by the slipping counter thus disappears
from the screen the moment it is set to its initial position. It then
remains invisible until a cycle is started; then it becomes a visible
moving object on the screen.

An astute reader who has been following this discussion care-
fully might now be seeing some important applications of the circuit
in Fig. 6-14. Doesn’t the operation of this circuit remind you of some
of the missile-launching operations included in some of the more
popular commercial TV games?
