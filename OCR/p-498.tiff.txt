Fig. 12-3. Circuit for combining V-count tones from two different sources.

thereby allowing the 4V frequency to pass. The inverter action of
ICZ-A, however, transforms the logic 1 from ICl-A to a zero level
that gates off ICZ—B. Whenever IC1-A switches to its 0 output state,
the situation is reversed: ICZ—B is gated on to allow the 8V signal to
pass and ICZ—C is gated off.

Neither of these frequencies appears at the AUDIO output of
the circuit unless IC3-A is gated on by a logic-1 level at its pin—2
input. And that signal comes from IC1-B.

ICl-B is connected as a monostable multivibrator that is set to
its timing state only when the desired triggering event occurs.
Maybe this event occurs when the player depresses the trigger on
some sort of ray gun. In any event, a negative-going pulse at C1
starts the timing action of ICl-B and allows the “deedle-deedle”
sounds to pass through IC3-A to the audio ampliﬁer.
