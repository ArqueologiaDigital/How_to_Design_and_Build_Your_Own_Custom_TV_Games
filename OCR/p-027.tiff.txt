One HCLK pulse after the count reaches 4_5_4, however, IC5—A
loads its Q output with a logic-0 level and the Qoutput takes on a
logic—1 level. This condition immediately clears all nine bits from the
horizontal-count source to zero, thus restarting the 455«step opera-
tion all over again.

The signal from the Q output of IC5-A is thus a negative-going
pulse that lasts for one HCLK pulse interval and occurs at the very
beginning of each horizontal-count cycle. A positive- going version of
that same pulse, HRST, is directed to 1C2, 1C3, and the plug
assembly leading to the outside world.

The circuit build around the four Z-input NAN D gates of 1C6 are
responsible for generating the horizontal blanking (HBLANK) and
inverted horizontal sync (HSYQLpulses. IC6-B and lC6-C make up
what is commonly known as a R—S f lip-ﬂop. Whenever the negative—
going HRST pulse is directed to the pin—10 input of IC6-C, the output
of that same 1C is set to a logic—1 level. The device remains in that
state while the horizontal—count source is cleared and restarted. The
moment the count reaches 80, as determined by the 16H and 64H
inputs to IC6-A, this ﬂip-ﬂop circuit is reset so that the pin—8 output
of IC6-C returns to logic 0. This point then remains at logic 0 until
another HRSTpulse occurs.

The real signiﬁcance of the output of IC6-C is that it generates
the system’s HBLANK pulse, a positive pulse that begins as the
horizontal-count circuit is reset to zero and ends 80 HCLK pulses
later. Ultimately the beam on the TV screen will be blanked off
through this 80-pulse, horizontal blanking interval.

The horizontal sync pulse is generated at IC6-D. This NAND
gate is normally gated off by the logic-0 level from IC6-C. Whenever
lC6—C is generating an HBLANK signal, however, IC6-D is open to
the 32H signal at its pin-12 input. An inverted version of 32H thus
appears at the output of IC6-D, but only through the horizontal
blanking interval. See the waveforms in Fig. 2-5.

Looking at the HBLANK and HSYNC sequence in detail, the
positive HBLAN K pulse begins ﬁrst. Thirty-two clock pulses later,
the inverted HSYNC pulse begins, lasting through count 64.
HBLAN K ﬁnallyendsat count 80. The overall effect is a combination
of horizontal blanking and sync pulses that work very much like their
counterparts in a commercial TV broadcast signal.

The only purpose of audio ampliﬁer 1C8 is to amplify any
special—effects sounds and match the circuit to an 8-ohm
loudspeaker. Since audio special effects are not described until
Chapter 10, the volume control and loudspeaker need not be con-
nected at this time.
