The general procedure is to determine the sine and cosine of
the angles, then use the table in Fig. 7 ~22 to find the closest possible
velocities for each. The sine of the angle determines the vertical
velocity, while the cosine determines the horizontal velocity.

Table 11-21b shows the results of this translation process,
assuming it will be carried out by means of a set of multiplexer
circuits.

The resulting circuit diagram for the angle-to-motion translator
is shown in Fig. 11-22. Figure 11-23 shows how the translator
interfaces with the 8 X 8 rotatable ﬁgure and a slipping-counter
board.

A similar approach using universal position programmers
(Chapter 8) would provide a much wider range of ﬁgure speeds, but
only at the cost of greater circuit complexity.
