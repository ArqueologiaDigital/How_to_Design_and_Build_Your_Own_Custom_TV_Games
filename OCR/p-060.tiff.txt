Fig. 3-9. An RC technique for generating very narrow white lines. (a) Setting up
the starting point of the line. (b) Modifying the circuit to make the line as narrow as
desired.

Any line that is narrowed by this RC technique can be combined
with other lines by ﬁrst removing the output inverter and then
applying the signal to one input of a NAND gate, the NAND gate
used for combining lines from a number of line-generating circuits.
See the example in Fig. 3-10. ‘

Building Broad Bars More Effectively

Anyone who has now experimented with the basic Tinkerbox
technique for generating lines and bars might be picking up another
shortcoming to the system: it is all but impossible to make a white
bar that crosses the dividing line between black 256H and white
256H.

The dividing line between the black and white areas of the basic
256H pattern is a unique point in the overall horizontal-count se-
quence. At that particular point, every H-count signal switches from
logic 1 to logic 0. They all make a transition from white to black. The
signiﬁcance of this fact is that it requires some special logic trickery
to make a wide white bar extend continuously through this unique
dividing line; and that particular bit of trickery hasn’t been fully
described yet.
