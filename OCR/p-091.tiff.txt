number of cells available in the matrix, and unfortunately, the basic
16-ce11 matrix is a bit too elementary to be of much use.

It turns out, however, that it is possible to apply a simple
matrix—extension procedure to double the number of cells in any
basic matrix. Using this procedure, for instance, immediately trans—
forms the 4x4 matrix shown in Fig. 4—4a into a 32—cell, 4x8 matrix
(See Fig. 4—8).

One of the special features of the matrix-extension technique
used in this book is that it does not call for adding any hardware to the
basic matrix-generating circuit. The circuit for generating the 32-cell
matrix in Fig. 4-8 is exactly the same as that described in connection
with the 16-cell circuit in Fig. 4—5.

Thus it is possible to double the essential qualities of a matrix-
generating circuit without having to add more hardware. And that is
one ﬁne example of applied engineering efﬁciency.

The only real difference between the speciﬁcations for a basic
16-cell matrix and its 32-cell extended version is the D-input format.
Whereas a basic matrix calls for inputs of either logic 0 or 1, the
extended version calls for logic 1, 0, and inverted/noninverted
vertical—count signals. Compare the D—input speciﬁcation for the
4X8 extended matrix in Fig. 4-8 with those for the basic 4x4 matrix
in Fig. 4-6.

Rather than launching a highly technical theory of operation at
this point, it is better (in this case anyway) to try the scheme ﬁrst.

Using the circuit shown in Fig. 4—5, modify its select and
Window speciﬁcations as prescribed in Fig. 4-8. Do not make any
connections to the D inputs at this time.

After carrying out this initial setup procedure, you should ﬁnd a
4 x 16 white rectangle resting in the lower right-hand quadrant of the
screen. This is the extended 4 X8 matrix having all D inputs equal to
logic 1.

Connect one end of a jumper wire to logic 0 (COMM) and touch
the other end to the multiplexer’s D0 input. You will ﬁnd two black
squares appearing on the screen. One is in the D0 position of the
matrix and the other is in the DOE position. Here is the ﬁrst
important point. A logic-0 level applied to any one of the 16 D inputs
on the multiplexer creates 2 black squares. One of these squares
appears in the designated D—input position, while the other appears
in the corresponding extended-matrix position.

Tap the logic—0 jumper wire to all 16 D inputs in succession and
note how it eliminates 2 cells at one time. Of course you can connect
all 16 D inputs to logic 0 and end up blacking out all 32 matrix cells-2
at a time.
