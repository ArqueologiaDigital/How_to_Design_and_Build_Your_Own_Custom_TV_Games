BUILDING RECTANGLES

Recall that the basic Tinkerbox technique for building vertical or
horizontal bars calls for logically ANDing together white areas. The
scheme uses a NAND gate followed by an inverter circuit, and the
resulting image is a white bar that exists wherever the white areas of
the input signals overlap. Building a rectangular ﬁgure on the screen
is a matter of ﬁrst building two white bars, one vertical and the other
horizontal. The two signals are then ANDed together such that the
resulting image represents the area where their white areas over-
lap. See the example in Fig. 3-17.

The white vertical bar in Fig. 3-17a is a generated by any one of
the bar-generating techniques described in the previous section.
The horizontal bar in Fig. 3-17a is generated in a similar fashion,
using combinations of vertical-count inputs, of course.

These two signals are then combined in yet another NAND/
invert combination on the Tinkerbox breadboard. The image on the
screen represents the area where the two white bars overlap. It is
always a rectangular ﬁgure.

In a very real sense, a rectangle is formed on the screen by
specifying its horizontal and vertical coordinates. The vertical coor-
dinate in this case is a vertical white bar, and the horizontal coordi-
nate is a horizontal white bar. It doesn’t make any difference how
these bar coordinates are generated; if they are ANDed together
with a NAN D/invert combination, the result is a white rectangle on
the screen.

Of course the output could be taken ahead of the inverter
portion of this circuit to produce a black rectangle on a white ﬁeld.

Figure 3-18 shows a model circuit for generating a rectangle of
just about any dimensions anywhere on the screen. The vertical and
horizontal coordinates are generated by a straightforward NAND-
gate procedure, using the Tinkerbox components. The outputs of
