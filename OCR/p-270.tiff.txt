At the same time the latches are set to their memory mode, 1C9
shifts the synchronizing pulses for the secondary ﬁgure from that of
the primary ﬁgure to its own set of pulses, SHMRST and SVMRS T .

The secondary ﬁgure thus ﬂies under its own set of motion
codes and synchronizing pulses until FIRE is set to logic 1 again. The
instant WEE is returned to logic 1, the secondary ﬁgure immediately
snaps back to the primary ﬁgure, following the motion codes and
synchronizing pulses speciﬁed for the primary ﬁgure.

1C8 in Fig. 7-13 is simply the initialization control for the
primary ﬁgure. As long as PIN TP is atlgg__i_c_0, this 2:1 multiplexer
circuit directs initial-position pulses, PHINT and PVINT to the
primary-figure’s reset inputs, thus holding the primary ﬁgure ﬁxed at
one particular position on the screen. As soon as PINTP is set to
logic 1, the primary ﬁgure is free to “ﬂy” under the control of the
4-bit words from 1C3 and 1C5.

Figure 7-14 shows a complete wiring block diagram for the
tagalong system. The tagalong control board is the one just de-
scribed in connection with the schematic in Fig. 7-13. The two
slipping-counter boards are identical (Fig. 5-15), although board N o.
1 is reserved for the primary ﬁgure and No. 2 for the secondary
ﬁgure.

All the wiring between the tagalong-control board and the two
slipping-counter boards is necessary in any tagalong operation. The
experimenter is free to use only those slipping-counter outputs that
are required for a particular game, however.

The slipping-counter boards consume a great deal of power
from the power supply. In fact the two of them in Fig. 7-14 run a 5V,
1A regulator to its limits. One power supply regulator must be
dedicated to these slipping-counter boards, and the power for the
tagalong-control board must be taken from a second regulator cir-
cuit.

 

Torpedo Attack Block Diagram

We have had to depart from a detailed description of the tor-
pedo game in order to discuss the operation of potentiometer-
controlled speed and direction circuits as well as the basic tagalong
control. It would probably be a good idea to refresh your ideas about
the torpedo game, reviewing the action of the control panels and ﬂow
chart, before resuming this particular discussion.

Figure 7-15a shows the basic block diagram for the defense
torpedo system. A command to launch any one of the four DTs
comes from the DT launch panel goes to the DT horizontal position
