The initializing control can be used with a horizontal—slipping
counter in much the same way it is used with vertical-slipping
counters. See Fig. 6—13a. Using the circuit in Fig. 5-14 as a model for
horizontal-slipping counters, simply break the connection between
the output of ICS—A (the gate that signals a normal reset) and the load
bus line to pin 11 of ICs 1 and 2 and pin 3 of IC3-A.

Any image generated by the horizontal-slipping counter will be
initialized by IN TP in Fig. 6-13a as long as the INTC input is at logic
0. Changing the status of INTP to logic 1 shifts the counter’s reset
operation to the output of IC5-A, thereby allowing the motion
speciﬁed by the slipping counter’s VC inputs.

Many TV games call for ﬁgures that move with both horizontal
and vertical components of motion. The motion-control board in Fig.
5-15 is a natural choice for a circuit in this case; and if the circuit is to
include an initializing feature, a pair of initializing controls, one each
for horizontal and vertical motion, can be inserted in the reset line.

Using the initialization-control circuit described thus far re-
quires three 2-input NAND gates and an inverter, and that would
mean using a total of six NAND gates and two inverters for achieving
initialization control over both vertical and horizontal motion of the
same ﬁgure. It is possible to reduce the IC count by replacing the
NAN D-gate version of the initializing control with a 74157 quad 2:1
multiplexer. See Fig. 6-13b.

The circuit in Fig. 6-13b uses a single IC package for simultane-
ously controlling the initialization process of a ﬁgure having both
vertical- and horizontal-motion components. As long as INTC in Fig.
6-13b is set to logic 0, the multiplexer selects VINTP and HINTP
inputs (initializing pulses) for the vertical— and horizontal-slipping
counters on the motion-control board. The effect in this case is that
the ﬁgure generated by these slipping counters stands motionless in
its initial position, regardless of the status of the VC and HC inputs.

Setting INTC in Fig. 6-13b to logic 1, on the other hand, lets the
ﬂuiplexer deliver HMRST and VMRSTpulses for the HML and
VML inputs of the motion-control board. The ﬁgure thus moves in a
direction and at a speed determined by the HC and VC inputs.

Serious experimenters might ﬁnd it very instructive to bread-
board the initializing-control circuit in Fig. 6-13b and attach it to the
motion-control board in Fig. 5-15. Generate the desired ﬁgure from
the VM and HM outputs of the slipping counters While the control
circuit is initializing them. The most convenient source of initializing
pulses is inverted versions of HRST and VRST from the Sourcebox.
Simply apply an inverted version of HRST to the HINTP input in Fig.
