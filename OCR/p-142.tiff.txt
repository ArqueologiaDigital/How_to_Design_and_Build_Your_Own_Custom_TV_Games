described in Chapter 3, Building Narrow Lines More Effectively.
Without the pulse-shortening feature, you would ﬁnd that the circuit
generates a broad white bar that begins at the top or left—hand side of
the screen and extends for a distance ﬁxed by R1. While this might
create an interesting, and perhaps potentially useful visual effect,
the adjustable-width white bar has little application for player-
controlled motion.

The pulse-shortening circuit effectively generates a narrow
white bar that always occurs at the end of the broad, adjustable-
Width bar image from the timer.

Timing resistor R3 has a value of 470 ohms for both the movable
horizontal and vertical line. Capacitor C3, however, should be ﬁxed
at about 0.004 “F for the movable vertical bar and at 1 ”F for a
horizontal bar.

Build the circuit shown in Fig. 5-‘2, setting the values ﬁrst for a
movable horizontal bar and then again for a movable vertical bar. You
can, of course, adjust or modify any of the recommended values of
R2, C2, and C3 to create any special position and size effects. Just
bear in mind that R2 and C2 inﬂuence the position and motion of the
bar, while C3 determines its width.

A movable line that spans the entire height or Width of the
screen has limited usefulness for ordinary video games. The next
phase of the development, then, is to Window the line, restricting its
size a bit. Try the circuit in Fig. 5—3.

The circuit in Fig. 53 generates an image that is quite familiar
to anyone who has observed or played with commercial video
games. If you don’t feel a bit of excitement when you see what you
are creating on the screen with this circuit, you are probably missing
the spirit of this whole enterprise.

All you have to do is rig up the circuit in Fig. 5-2 to generate a
movable horizontal bar, then window it with some H—count signals.
The NOR gate in this instance effectively ANDs together the mova—
ble bar and window signals, yielding an image that looks very much
like the paddle devices for countless video games on the market
today.

Note that the “paddle” is movable along a ﬁxed vertical path.
The vertical position of the image is determined by the setting of R1,
while the window speciﬁcations determine the ﬁxed horizontal posi-
tion and width. Capacitor C3 and resistor R3 in the monostable
circuit ﬁx the height of the “paddle.”

After playing with this circuit for a while, you might want to
reorient it to create a “paddle” that is movable along a ﬁxed horizon-
