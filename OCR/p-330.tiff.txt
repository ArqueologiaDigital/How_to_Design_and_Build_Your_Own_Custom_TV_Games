Figure 8-13 shows a set of curves that translate the multivi-
brator’s operating frequency into numbers indicating the speed of
the bar. Those numbers indicate the length of time required for
making one complete cycle of motion across the screen. If, for
example, the system is operating from H—count signals from the
Sourcebox, and the multivibrator is operating at 1 kHz[, the Horizon-
tal Motion curve shows that the bar will complete one cycle of
horizontal motion across the screen in about 7.6 seconds.

If the inputs to the comparators in Fig. 8—9 are taken from the
V—count signals from the Sourcebox, the bar moves vertically at a
rate shown by the Vertical Motion curve. In the case of vertical
motion, setting the UP/ DOWN switch to UP causes the bar to move
downward, while setting that switch to DOWN causes the bar to
move upward. (If this seems to cause some confusion, simply bear in
mind that the UP and DOWN designations on the direction switch
indicate the direction of the counter, and not the direction of motion.

A Slow-Motion Figure Generator

A thoughtful reader ought to be asking some relevant questions
at this pont. Why should I ever build a ﬁgure-motion-control circuit
around a set of counter/comparator Circuits when the slipping
counters are simpler? What can this universal position programmer
do that cannot be done with the simpler positioning circuits de—
scribed earlier in this chapter?

Both questions can be answered in the following terms. The
universal position programmer is, indeed, a more complicated sys-
tem than any slipping counter and position programmer. The fact of
the matter is, however, that this universal programmer can perform
some operations that are virtually impossible with the simpler cir-
cuits.

The case in point is the speed of motion that can be generated
by the programmer circuit in Fig. 8-9. The slipping-counter-
motion—control circuit is analyzed in terms of its operating speeds in
Fig. 7 -22. According to that table, the circuit cannot generate ﬁgure
speeds less than 6.2 seconds per screen. The minimum cycle time
for the ﬁgure is either inﬁnity (ﬁgure motionless) or 6.2 seconds.

Using the universal programmer as a motion-control circuit,
however, allows ﬁgure—cycling times on the order of 20 seconds. In
essence, the universal programmer can be used as an ultra-slow-
motion generator. Having a ﬁgure move across the screen in 6.2
seconds (the greatest amount of time possible with a slipping-
counter arrangement) might be too fast for many game applications.
