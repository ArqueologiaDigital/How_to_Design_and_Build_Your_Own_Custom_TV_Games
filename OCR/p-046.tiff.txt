Now wire the circuit in Fig. 3-4b. There are two inputs in this
instance. The waveform from 256H is applied to an inverter circuit
and then to one input of the 8—input NAND gate. The other input,
128H, goes directly to a second input of the NAND gate. The little
screen ﬁgures accompanying the diagram in Fig. 3-4b show the
patterns appearing on the TV screen as GAME VID IN is connected
to various test points.

The essential point to note in Fig. 3-4 is the fact that thegutput
ﬁgure shows a white bar only where the white bars for 256H and
128H overlap. In digital logic terminology, this circuit ANDs to-
gether the two signals appearing at the input of the NAND gate.

It is impossible to build the single white bar generated as the
output of this circuit from any one horizontal-count output.

What would happen if both inputs are inverted before applying
them to the NAND gate? Figure 3—4c demonstrates the answer to
that question. The NAN D_gat_e does the same job as before, but now
the whites for '2'5—613 and 128H overlap only at the right-hand edge of
the screen.

Play with this basic idea, using various combinations of inverted
and noninverted H inputs to the NAND gate. You might be puzzled
with some of the results at this point, but the exact procedures for
generating a vertical line at one desired place on the screen are
outlined in great detail later in this section.

Incidentally, if you happen to stumble across some patterns that
look especially useful or interesting for later work, take careful note
of the circuit connections. Keep the results recorded in a notebook
for future reference.

Figure 3-5 shows some similar tricks with the vertical-count
signals. In Fig. 3-5a, the inputs are 128V and 64V; and as in the case
of the horizontal demonstrations, the overall result is a white bar
appearing at the location where the white bars at the inputs overlap.

White playing with various combinations of V signals, re-
member that 256V is not a very useful or interesting waveform. An
inverted version of the 256V signal has little noticeable effect on
these demonstrations, while a noninverted version applied to the
input of the NAN D gate blanks out just about all the useful working
area of the screen.

The Tinkerbox, as described to this point, can be the source of
a whole evenings entertainment for you. Your family and friends
might not be overly impressed with the results at this time, but as
long as you are having fun with the system and learning things as you
progress, that is all that really counts.
