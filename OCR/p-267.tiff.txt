Suppose the secondary ﬁgure (the attack torpedo in this case) is
supposed to be taging alongwith the primary ﬁgure (the attack
craft). In this instance, the FIRE input to 1C6, IC7, and ICQ is at logic
1. This particular logic level sets memory latches 106 and IC7 to
their “read” modes—they are passing any 4-bit words at their inputs
directly to their outputs. In other words, any change in the 4-bit
words from 1C3 and 1C5 appears immediately at the outputs of IC6
and IC7 respectively.

The output designations from 1C6 and IC7 imply they are 4-bit
motion-control words for the horizontal— and vertical-slipping coun-
ters on the secondary-ﬁgure slipping-counter—motion board. ISHC
through SSHC from 1C6, for instance, are connected to the IHC
through 8HC control terminals of the horizontal counter, while 18VC
through 8SVC go to their respective vertical-counting-control in-
puts, lVC through 8VC.

The two 4-bit motion-control words for the primary-ﬁgure
slipping-counter board are taken ahead of ICs 6 and 7. These outputs
are designated 1PVC through 8PVC and 1PHC through SPHC.

As long as FIRE is at logic 1, then, both motion-control boards

see the same sets of motion-control codes, and whatever changes in
motion are prescribed for the primary ﬁgure are likewise delivered
to the secondary ﬁgure.
___;l‘he 2:1 multiplexer, _I_§_S_9_,_ also works under the control of the
FIRE signal. As long as F IRE=1, slipping-counter synchronizing
pulses for the primary and secondary figure are identical:
PHML=SHML, m=SVMl.. The primary and secondary ﬁ-
gures thus appear at the same place on the screen.

As long as m=L the player has complete control over the
motion of both the primary and secondary ﬁgures by means of
controls R1 and R3. And what’s more, the secondary ﬁgure is always
superimposed on the primary one. The latter follows the former,
wherever it might go.

The picture changes completely, however, when m is set to
logic 0. The player still has complete control over the primary ﬁgure
as before, but now latches IC6 and IC7 are set to their memory
modes. The 4-bit motion-control words appearing at their outputs
are ﬁxed at the values present the moment FIRE changed from 1 to
0.

 

 

The result is that the secondary ﬁgure continues moving in the
direction and at a speed speciﬁed at the moment FIR—E is changed
from 1 to 0. The player has no control over the motion of the
secondary ﬁgure then.
