Fig. 3-6. Building white vertical lines and combining them into a single video
signal. (a) Circuit for determining the horizontal—count specifications for each
line. (b) Combining two simpliﬁed versions of the line—generating circuit.

Once you have formed this line, take careful note of the exact
H—count inputs you used, and show whether each of them should be
inverted or noninverted.

Unless you are trying to build an extremely narrow line, you
won’t really need more than four combinations of inverted and
noninverted inputs to the NAND gate. If it turns out that the line
requires only two inputs, transfer the connections to the 8-input
NAN D gate over to one of the 2-input NAND gates in 1C4. (Refer to
Fig. 3-2 for the appropriate pin numbers.) If the line calls for three or
