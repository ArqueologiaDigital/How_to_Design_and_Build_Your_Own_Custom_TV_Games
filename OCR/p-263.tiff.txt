missile’s path enter motion data via a set of switches. The control
input in this case is purely digital.

Digital speed and direction controls, however, are not always
the most appropriate. It is often more helpful and realistic to control
the motion of a ﬁgure by means of dials—potentiometers, to be more
speciﬁc.

Figure 7-12 shows a relatively simple circuit that converts the
digital motion-control input into an analog format. In essence, this
circuit .converts the setting of a potentiometer into a 4-bit binary
number for controlling the count length of a slipping counter. Using
this scheme, a player controls the speed and direction of an image by
turning the shaft of the variable resistor, R2.

This elementary sort of A/D converter includes a 4-bit binary
counter (1C4), a monostable multivibrator having an adjustable out-
put timing interval (IC3), a clock-pulse gating circuit (ICZ-B), and a
synchronizing-pulse generator (IC2-A and ICI-B). The inputs to the
circuit are a 128V count pulse from the Sourcebox, a 2V count from
Sourcebox, and the main control resistor, R2. The output is a 4-bit
binary word that ultimately determines the speed and direction of
motion of a ﬁgure on the screen. The 4-bit output is the one required
for setting the count length of a slipping-counter circuit.

Two such circuits are required where the player is to have
control over both the horizontal and vertical components of motion.
The horizontal control includes the components‘ shown in the main
schematic in Fig. 7-12. 1C5, shown in the insert in Fig. 7-12, must be
added for potentiometer control of the vertical-motion component.

The waveforms in Fig. 7-12 illustrate the operation of the
circuit. Whenever 128V makes a transition from logic 0 to logic 1
(near the middle of the screen), the pulse generatgril‘CZ-A and
ICl-B) generates a negative-going pulse, designated 128P through-
out the remainder of this book.

The monostable multivibrator is programmed such that_its_
output timing interval is initiated on the trailing edge of the 128P
pulse. See the second waveform in Fig. 7-12. With the pin-3 output
of the monostable circuit thus set to logic 1, 2V pulses at pin 5 of
IC2-B are allowed to pass to the clocking input of the counter circuit,
1C4. The counter then increments at the 2V rate until the timing
interval is over.

When the timing interval is (ampleted, the counter holds its last
4—bit output count until another 128? pulse occurs. That brief pulse
clears the output of the counter to zero, letting the next counting
interval begin from zero.
