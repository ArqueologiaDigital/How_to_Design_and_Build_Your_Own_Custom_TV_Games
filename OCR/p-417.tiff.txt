Chapter 10
Figure Rebound Effects

 

The classic table-tennis and squash video games rely on a bouncing,
or rebounding, effect. Whenever the ball strikes a paddle or one of
the ﬁxed barriers, it instantly changes its direction of motion.

Such effects are appropriate for a lot of other kinds of video
games as well, and the purpose of this chapter is to provide the
background necessary for working the rebound effect into any de-
sired custom game.

Most of the examples cited here assume the rebounding ﬁgure
works from a slipping counter. As pointed out near the end of the
chapter, however, it is just as easy to achieve the same effects with a
ﬁgure generated by one of the position programming circuits in
Chapter 8.

The basic idea behind the rebound effect is to sense the mo-
ment a moving object makes contact with a second object, generally
a stationary one, then reverse the horizontal or vertical direction of
the moving object.

Suppose, for example, a ball ﬁgurexis moving horizontally to the
right. It then strikes a ﬁxed ﬁgure on the right-hand side of the
screen and immediately switches direction so that it is moving
horizontally to the left. That is one particular rebound effect. The
same idea can be applied to vertical ﬁgure motion, with-the object’s
direction of motion switching from up to down as it hits a ﬁgure near
the top of the screen. '

Figure 10-1 shows an up/down rebound scheme. It includes
ﬁgures for generating ﬁxed top and bottom ﬁgures as well as a ball
