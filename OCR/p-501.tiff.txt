The circuit in Fig. 12-6b can create the sound of machine gun
ﬁre. In this instance the noise signal is gated on and off by a
free-running multivibrator. As long as the FIRE input is at the logic-1
level, this oscillator runs at about 4 Hz, gating the NAN D gate on and
off, ultimately producing a string of staccato-like noise bursts. The
ﬁring rate can be adjusted by changing the values of R1 or R2, or
both.

Another source of game sounds takes advantage of a simple
digital-to—analog (D/ A) converter circuit. The idea is to translate any
source of digital words into a voltage level, and then use that voltage
level to create tones of various frequencies. Such a scheme is useful
for generating buzzing sounds that vary in pitch with the speed of a
ﬁgure moving on the screen or whistling sounds for falling bombs.
