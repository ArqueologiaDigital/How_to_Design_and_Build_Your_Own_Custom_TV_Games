Fig. 6-11. Circuit for initializing the position of a figure generated by a slipping
counter.

counters will reset at the bottom of the screen where VRST always
occurs.

Set the VC inputs for any desired direction and speed (see the
data in Fig. 5-13), feed VM128 to GAME VID IN, and use a jumper
wire for grounding INTC.

As long as INTC is grounded (ﬁxed at logic 0), the Wide white
bar on the screen should appear ﬁxed at the bottom of the screen.
Whenever INTC is disconnected from ground and connected to +5V
(logic 1), the bar moves in a direction and at a speed determined by
the VC inputs.

You can interrupt the motion and reset the position of the bar to
the bottom of the screen at any time by simply connecting INTC to
ground again. Connecting INTC to logic 0 initializes the position of
the bar figure—initializes its position at the bottom of the screen in
this case.

You can actually initialize the position of the bar anywhere on
the screen you want by choosing a different source of INTP pulses.
Try NANDing together 128V, 64V, 32V, and 16V, for example.
Apply the output of this NAND gate to the INTP connection instead
of VRST. You will ﬁnd that the broad bar takes on an initial position
just above the center of the screen whenever INTC is set to logic 0.
