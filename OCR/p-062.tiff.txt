The same sort of problem occurs when attempting to create a
broad white horizontal bar that extends through the dividing line of
the basic 128V image.

The technique for generating relatively broad white bars, either
vertical or horizontal, is the subject of this section. Besides allowing
the experimenter to build broad White bars across the center of the
screen, this technique often offers a more efﬁcient option to building
broad white bars anywhere on the screen. _ __

The basic idea, illustrated in Fig. 3—11, is to build a simple R-S
ﬂip—ﬂop from a pair (1 2-input NAND gates. To see how this circuit
works, suppose the Rand § inputs are normally at logic 1. If indeed
this is the case, momentarily pulling the S input down to RETC 0 sets
the Q input to logic 1, and Q remains at logic 1, even after S returns
to logic 1. The only valid way to return the Q output to logic 0 once
again is to pull the R input to logic 0 for _a_ moment. And after that, the
Q output remains at logic 0 until the S input sees another logic-0
pulse. _

In summary, the Q output is set to logic 1 whenever the S inpu_t
is pulsed with a logic-0 level, and Q is returned to logic 0 only when R
is pulsed to logic 0. The Q output, as its name implies, is merely an
inverted version of the Q output.

What is the signiﬁcance of this circuit in the context of building
broad white lines on the TV screen? It means that a White bar can be
initiated at one point on the screen and terminated at any other point
to the right of it. It is a matter of coming up with two narrow-line
signals, one that switches on the white line and another that switches
it off.

Suppose, for example, you have built a Tinkerbox circuit that
draws two parallel vertical lines on the screen. The width of the lines
isn’t really important, just as long as they don’t overlap. Now con—
nect__the output of the NAND gate generating the line on the left to
the S input of the flip-ﬂop, and connect the output of the NAN D gate
generating the second line to the R input. You will ﬁnd that the Q
input of the ﬂip-ﬂop circuit generates a broad white, vertical bar that
begins when the left-hand line begins and ends where the right-hand
line begins.

Any technique you use to generate a pair of parallel lines can be
applied here. The resulting white bar will always cover the space
between the beginning of the ﬁrst and last lines. This rule holds as
long as (1) the two original parallel lines do not overlap and (2) there
are only two parallel lines.

Figure 3-12 shows one of the author’s circuits for building a
white vertical bar that extends across the center of the screen.
