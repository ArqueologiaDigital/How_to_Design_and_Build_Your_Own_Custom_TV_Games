however, add some interest by changing the attack missile’s motion
parameters. But that is the subject of the reﬁnements described
later in this chapter.

The block diagram in Fig. 6-15b shows the main control ele-
ments for this missile attack game. The circuit has only one control
input, the LAUNCH “A” block in the upper left-hand corner of the
diagram. The sole output is the GAME VIDEO terminal at the
center right. Also note that the system uses the slipping-counter—
motion~control board from Fig. 5-15. The vertical counter on that
board ﬁxes the speed and direction of the image A antiballistic
missile, while the horizontal-slipping counter ﬁxes the motion of the
image B attack missile.

The purpose of most of the blocks in Fig. 6-15b can be related to
the flow chart. Some of the blocks perform operations that are
outside the realm of direct control operations, so we ought to take a
moment to look at them a bit closer.

The “A” IMAGE block, for instance, generates the image of the
antiballistic missile. Since this little rectangular ﬁgure moves in the
vertical direction only, the only slipping—counter inputs required are
those for generating the ﬁgure’s vertical—position information—
some VM count signals from the motion-control board. The ﬁgure’s
horizontal position is ﬁxed by H—count pulses from the Sourcebox.

The “B” IMAGE block performs the same general function,
generating the attack-missile image. In this case, the motion is in a
horizontal direction, so this block must include HM inputs from the
motion-control board. V—count signals from the Sourcebox ﬁx the
missile’s vertical position, or altitude.

The game must include provisions for sensing a contact bet-
ween the antiballistic missile and the top of the screen. Recall that
this event occurs only when the missile is ﬁred, but misses the attack
missile. The “top of the screen” is deﬁned by the “A” TOP LOGIC
block, and is based purely on V-count data from the Sourcebox unit.

And ﬁnally, there must be some means for sensing a contact
between the attack missile and the right-hand side of the screen.
The “B” EDGE LOGIC block deﬁnes the right-hand side of the
screen, and this is a simple matter of NAN Ding together the approp-
riate H-count signals from the Sourcebox.

A preliminary analysis of the circuit shows that two circuit
boards are required for this particular game. One board is the
motion-control board shown in Fig. 5-15, and the other is the game
control scheme in Fig. 6-16.

Most of the circuitry in Fig. 6-16 can be related directly to the
block diagram and then to speciﬁc control circuits described earlier in
