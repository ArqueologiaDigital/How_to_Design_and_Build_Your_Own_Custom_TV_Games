ming, the ﬁgure is extended vertically by 128V: the upper half of the
ﬁgure is generated while 128V is low, and the lower half is generated
while 128V is high. This feature is implemented in Fig. 10-9 by the
128V connection to a number of D inputs to 1C7.

The paddle ﬁgures are to be in their resting position as long as
the PADDLE button is not depressed, but then they should move to
their center-screen positions when that button is depressed. This
