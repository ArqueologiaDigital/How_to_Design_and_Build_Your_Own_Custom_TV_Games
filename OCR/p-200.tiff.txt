combined with the data for image B to produce a composite video
signal. As long as this gate is open, both images can appear on the
screen. Closing the gate, however, blanks image A from the screen,
but lets image B remain.

The blanking operation is controlled by an R-S ﬂip-ﬂop circuit.
In this instance, it is the circuit shown earlier in Fig. 6-1b. Now the
ﬂip-ﬂop is controlled by positive-pulse inputs from the contact sens-
ing circuit and some sort of outside reset circuit.

When the game is reset, the state of the ﬂip-ﬂop is set such that
the A blank gate is open, allowing image A data to appear on the
screen. The ﬁrst contact-sensing pulse from the contact sensor,
however, sets the ﬂip—ﬂop to a state where the A image is blanked
off.

With the ﬂow chart and block diagram completed, the next step
is to work out a preliminary schematic diagram. This diagram, along
with an analysis of the type and number of logic gates required,
appears in Fig. 6-10a. See if you can properly relate the gate circuits
in Fig. 6—10a with the operations speciﬁed in the block diagram.

The ﬁnal schematic diagram in Fig. 6-10b shows how this whole
operation can be implemented with three ICs.

INITIALIZING FIGURE MOTION CONTROLS

Games and game cycles often begin with certain ﬁgures placed
at particular places on the screen. Such ﬁgures must be set to those
initial positions whenever some critical event occurs. In the case of a
table-tennis game, the ball is set to an initial position for serving
purposes. It is then served, and if the player misses it, the ball
travels to one side of the screen where it then disappears, being
served again from the opposite side of the screen. The critical event
in this case occurs when the ball reaches the opposite side of the
screen. When that happens, it is ﬁrst blanked and then initialized (set
to a particular serving position).

Initializing operations are nearly always used in conjunction
with ﬁgures that move around the screen automatically, although
some manually controlled ﬁgures use initializing operations as well.

Figure 6—11 shows the basic initializing circuit. It is most often
used with vertical- and horizontal-slipping counters, and the basic
idea is to select one of two different sources of reset pulses for the
counting operation. The two sources of reset pulses are labeled
slipping-counter reset and initializing reset in this case. The slipping-
counter reset pulses come from the slipping-counter circuit itself.
These are the pulses that are normally used for resetting the counter
to achieve the desired speed and direction of motion. They are
