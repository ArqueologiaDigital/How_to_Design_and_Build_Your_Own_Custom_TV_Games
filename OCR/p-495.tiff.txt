Sound Effects

 

Most commercial video games feature some interesting sound ef-
fects. Such effects are rarely a vital part of the games, themselves,
but they add to the fun of the whole thing.

Rather than presenting a wide variety of sound-generating
circuits that have speciﬁc applications, this chapter shows how
certain classes of sounds can be generated, leaving it to the know-
how and imagination of the experimenter to apply them as desired.

TUNES FROM THE V-COUNT SIGNALS

Figure 12-1 lists some of the frequencies in the audio range that
are available directly from the V-count outputs of the Sourcebox
unit. These tones are available continuously as long as the Source-
box unit is turned on. To get a good idea how these signals sound,
connect any one of them directly to the AUDIO IN pin on the
Sourcebox, adjusting the volume control for a comfortable listening
level.

Steady tones are rarely useful for video games, however, so
there must be some provisions for switching them on and off at the
appropriate times. Figure 12—2 shows an experimental breadboard
circuit for controlling the tone from a negative-going control pulse.

The circuit in Fig. 12—2 is basically a monostable multivibrator
built around a 555-type timer. Whenever switch 8 is depressed, a
short negative-going pulse is coupled through C1 to the trigger input
of the monostable circuit. Its output from pin 3 then goes to a logic-1
