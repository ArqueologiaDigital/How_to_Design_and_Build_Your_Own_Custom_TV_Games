Whenever the player depresses the START button on the
control panel, a negative-gging logic level at pin 5 of ICl-B in Fig.
8-25 sets the state of a R—S flip-ﬂop. The ﬂip—ﬂop responds by
showing a negative-going edge at pin 3 of ICl-A. That edge-triggers
a pulse-generator circuit composed of ICl-C and IC4-A. The brief
negative-going pulse from that pulse generator triggers ICG-A, the
game’s 3-minute master timer circuit. Depressing the START but-
ton thus initiates a 3-minute monostable timing interval that can be
interrupted only by a logic-0 level to pin 4 of that timer device. Of
course that GHIT input indicates the good guy has been hit.

Now note that the output of the master game timer (IC6-A,_pi_n
5) goes to a pulse generator and then to the resetting input of the RS
ﬂip—ﬂop (pin 1 of ICl-A). The game is thus reset whenever the
output of IC6—A makes a transition from logic 1 to 0. And that occurs
when (1) the 3-minute game time expires or (2) the good guy is shot.

Depressing the START button also sends a logic 1 level to pin 8
of IC6-B. This enables the monostable so that the good guy can ﬁre a
shot by depressing the FIRE button. The shot is timed by IC6~B so
that it lasts only about 1/10 second, but if GV=BV (good-guy
vertical equals bad-guy vertical), the output of ICl-D registers a hit
in favor of the good guy.

The pulse from ICl-D initiates a l-second timing interval
(monostable IC7—A) which, in turn, enables the bad-guy ﬂashing
action of IC7-B. A pulse generator connected to the pin—5 output of
the ﬂash timer generates a negative-going pulse and the end of the
ﬂashing time, indicating it is time to call up a new bad guy ﬁgure.

Once the game is started, then, the player can ﬁre at any time
by depressing the FIRE pushbutton. If the bad-guy ﬁgure happens to
be in the line of ﬁre at the time, the bad-guy ﬁgure ﬂashes on the
screen and is replaced by another bad guy a second later.

All of this assumes the good guy isn’t hit ﬁrst. Whenever the
good guy is hit, the resulting logic-O level at pin 10 of IC6-B locks out
the good guy’s ﬁring circuit. A dead man can’t ﬁre a gun, you see.

IC8-A and its associated components in Fig. 8-25 are responsi-
ble for setting the vertical position of the good guy by means of the
MOVE control. A complete description of this “sloppy” control
appears in conjunction with the circuit in Fig. 5-6. The value of C11 in
this particular circuit can be selected to ﬁx the vertical size of the
good-guy ﬁgure.

IC5-A fixes the horizontal part of the good-guy figure.
Capacitor C12 can be selected to scale the width of that ﬁgure. The
vertical and horizontal components of the good-guy ﬁgure are thus
available from pin 6 and pin 8 of 1C4.
