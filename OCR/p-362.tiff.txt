START button for beginning a new game and attack sequence, and a
FIRE button that makes the good guy shoot a beam Of light at the
stormtroopers.

Depressing the START button initializes the position of all eight
stormtroopers at the top of the screen. Their advance toward the
good guy begins immediately. The stormtroopers are rigged so that
they all ﬁre a volley of shots at the good guy 0.1 second after they
sense one of them is lined up with the good guy. The good guy can
ﬁre at any time by depressing the FIRE button, but he, too, must be
lined up with one of the stormtroopers before scoring a kill.

Whenever the good guy hits one of the stormtroopers, they all
disappear from the screen for about 0. 5 second, then reappear with
the dead guy missing from the display. The main object of the game
is to kill them all in this fashion before any one of them reaches the
bottom of the screen.

If any live stormtroopers reach the end of the screen, the good
guy’s position, the game automatically stops to indicate a win for the
bad guys. The game has to be manually started to begin another
attack sequence.

The game is also terminated in the event the good guy manages
to wipe out all eight stormtroopers. This indicates a win for the good
8“)“

This is a fast-paced game that is very difﬁcult to win without a
lot of practice. Until a player masters the game, he might want to
score on the basis of the number of stormtroopers killed in 10
consecutive attack sequences, trying to beat this lO-game sequence
of scores.

Figures 8-29 through 8-33 show the general block diagram,
schematics for the three circuit boards, and a wiring block diagram.
The game takes advantage of the slow-motion feature of pro-
grammable position-control comparators. It is not possible to make
the stormtroopers advance so slowly using a slipping-counter
motion-control scheme.

A second feature of this game is its ability to blank ﬁgures from
the screen when they are “hit, ” and then keep track of the number of
remaining stormtroopers. Both of these features, extra-slow motion
and selective elimination of ﬁgures from the screen, can be de~
veloped into a number of other custom TV—game systems.

Theory of Operation

As indicated on the block diagram in Fig. 8-29, depressing the
START button both starts S MOTION and resurrects all previously
