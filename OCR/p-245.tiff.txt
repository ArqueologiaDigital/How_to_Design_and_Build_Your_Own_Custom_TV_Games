whenever the attack missile contacts either the bottom or right-hand
edge of the screen, and B=TARG generates a pulse Whenever the
attack missile hits the target.

Much of what remains to be explained in Fig. 7-50 can be
determined from the ﬂow chart in Fig. 7 -1. The A—reset logic block,
for instance, is responsible for resetting the position of the antiballis-
tic missile whenever A=B or A=TOP. This reset pulse is desig-
nated ARST.

Whenever A=B occurs, the pulse from that block also initiates
a ﬂash-time timer in the A=B ﬂash-time block. This block, in turn,
generates a logic-1 level that entables the A=B ﬂasher. And when
the timing is over, the pulse generator produces a brief pulse that
ultimately resets the position of the attack missile.

The attack missile is also reset the instant it reaches the bottom
or right—hand edge of the screen. The BRST logic_b‘lgc.l_<wthus gener-
ates a negative-going attack missile reset pulse (BRST) whenever
the A=B ﬂash timing is over or the missile contacts the edge of the
screen.

Whenever the B=TARG block senses a contact between the
attack missile and the target, it also initiates a ﬂash timer. This timer
enables the B=TARG ﬂashing circuit which, in turn, switches the
target-image data off and on in the target—ﬂash block.

Returning to the attack-missile ﬁgure for a moment, note the
B— ﬁgure ﬂash and blank block has two separate control inputs. The
image data for the attack missile (BFIG) can be completely blanked
off the screen while it is in its reset position. The BBLANK signal
from the attack-missile control system is responsible for this blank-
ing effect.

The same attack missile image, however, is also blanked on and
off by the A: B ﬂash circuit. In either case, the unblanked, blanked,
or ﬂashing 1mage data __e_merges as the BIMAGE signal.

The BIMAGE, AF IG and TIMAGE signals are all combined
into the game’s composite ﬁgure video at the video- logic block.

The ﬂashing circuits in Fig. 7 —5c are all described in connection
with the circuit in Fig. 7-4; the top-, edge-, and target-logic blocks
are variations of. the ﬁgure generators in Chapter 2. The contact-
sensing circuits are generally described in Chapter 6.

If you have been studying this book diligently, you will ﬁnd
nothing new here at all.
