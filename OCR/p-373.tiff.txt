Fig. 8-31. Stormtrooper board schematic.

1C4 in Fig. 8-31 is responsible for sensing the condition where
all eight stormtroopers are successfully eliminated. The inputs to
this NAND gate come from the Qoutputs of the ﬂip-ﬂops. When
these active-low outputs all reach a logic-1 state, the output of 1C4
drops to logic 0 to create the BALL signal, one of the three condi-
tions required for resetting the game sequence.

The operation of the Stormtrooper board in Fig. 8-31 is far
more difﬁcult to explain than to use. Any experimenter hoping to
