3. Is the resulting white bar to be further narrowed from the
left or right?
If from the left, use Ml
If from the right, use 64H

Continue including more H inputs, in decreasing order, until the
desired line width and position is achieved. Remember that including
an inverted H input narrows the bar from the right-hand side, while
including a true (noninverted) H input narrows the bar from the left.
Always begin with 256H and work one H input at a time toward 1H,
but use as few inputs as possible to simplify the ﬁnal circuit design.

After mastering the preceding technique for placing a vertical
bar or line at any desired position on the screen, building horizontal
bars will seem quite simple. Use the same combination of an 8-input
NAN D gate followed by an inverter, but apply vertical-count asignals
to the input of the NAND gate.

Begin the process with 128V. (256V isn’t very useful because
its ﬁrst white-to-black alternation takes place only four lines before
vertical blanking begins at the bottom of the screen.) If the desired
horizontal line is to appear in the white portion of 128V, you are
ready for the next step. But if the line is to be in the black region of
128V, invert that signal before applying it to the NAND gate.

Continue adding inverted or noninverted V-count inputs, in
decreasing order, until the resulting white bar has the desired
position and width. Note that adding a noninverted V-count input
narrows the bar from the top, and adding an inverted version of the
same signal narrows the bar from the bottom.

To check your understanding of the horizontal-bar-building
procedure, make a grease-pencil mark on the screen where you
would like a horizontal bar to appear. Then begin adding inverted or
noninverted V-count inputs to the NAND gate, beginning with 128V
and working downward through the lower-order V-counts signals.

The process can be summarized in a recipe for building a
horizontal line or bar.

Recipe for 3 Horizontal Line or Bar

Begin with a white screen, assuming it is actually a full-screen
horizontal bar.
1. Is that big bar to be narrowed from the bottom or top?
If from the top, use 128V_____
If from the bottom, use 128V
2. Is the resulting white bar to be further narrowed from the
top or bottom?
