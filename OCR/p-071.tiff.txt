these line-generating NAND gates are inverted, then applied to a
2—input NAN D gate. If the rectangle is to be white on a black ﬁeld,
the, signal from the 2-input NAND gate is run through yet another
inverter before applying it to GAME VID IN.

One good way to build a rectangle is to sketch its outline on the
TV screen with a grease pencil. Then work with the Tinkerbox
circuit to build a white vertical bar that runs down through the
rectangle drawing, ﬁtting the position and width as closely as possi-
ble. That operation speciﬁes the rectangle’s vertical component.
Write down the H—input speciﬁcations and repeat the operation,
generating a horizontal bar that ﬁts the rectangle’s speciﬁed position
and height. Again, mark down the V-input speciﬁcations.

Reduce the two circuits to their simplest NAND-gate forms and
feed their outputs to a 2-input NAND gate and inverter as shown in
Fig. 3-18. If you’ve speciﬁed the vertical and horizontal inputs
properly, there’s your rectangle on the screen.

This rectangle—building procedure can be summarized as fol-
lows.
