For the sake of this discussion, suppose you jumper JP1 to] 1H,
JPZ to 12H, JP3 to J3H, and so on down the line to the point where
you connect JP8 to 14V. Upon clearing the counters, then, the two
comparator circuits see 0000 and 0000 as positioning information.
HPP, in other words, will show a logic-1 comparison output
whenever 32H, 64H, 128H, and 256H are all equal to logic 0. The
same is true in this case for the V-count signals speciﬁed for 1C2.

What should you expect to see on the screen in this example?
Nothing at all. Beginning the horizontal and vertical bars at 0000
places them in the system’s horizontal- and vertical blanking re-
gions. But suppose you now depress the CLK pushbutton several
times (or advance the counter in any other suitable fashion) until the
inputs to 1C1 and IC2 are both 1001. This means a 32H-wide vertical
bar from HPP will appear at the point where 256H=1, 128H=0,
64H=, and 32H=1. That happens to specify a bar just a bit right of
center. The same set of four bits going to 1C2 would let VPP position
a horizontal bar across the middle of the screen. If the HPP and VPP
outputs are effectively ANDed together, you end up with a
32H><16V rectangle located just right of center on the screen.

Figure 8-8 indicates the positions of the bars under all possible
combinations of comparator inputs. It turns out that there are 14
uninterrupted vertical positions. (Out of a possible 16, 1 is lost in
vertical blanking and another is split between the bottom and top of
the screen.) As far as horizontal positioning is concerned, there are
11 uninterrupted positions (3 are lost in horizontal blanking and 2 are
split by the right- and left-hand sides of the screen).

The 32H x 16V rectangle generated by the outputs of the com-
parators in Fig. 8—7 and combined by the NAND gate shown in Fig.
8-8 can be positioned in any one of 154 different, uninterrupted
positions in the screen’s viewing area.

The correspondence between these 154 different positions and
the clocking of the circuit in Fig. 8-7 depends on the arrangement of
jumpers between the counters and comparators. If the jumpers are
connected as speciﬁed earlier in this section 0P1 to] 1H, JP2 to JZH,
and so on in that order through JP8 to 14V), clearing the counters to
zero places the ﬁgure in the horizontal- and vertical-blanking re-
gions. Clocking the counters causes no noticeable difference until
the count reaches 0010 and 1C1 and 0001 at 1C2. At that point, a
corner of the rectangle appears in the upper left-hand corner of the
screen. Subsequent clocking operations moves the rectangle to the
right across the top of the screen until it is lost in horizontal blanking
once again.
