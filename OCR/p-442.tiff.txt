(IC7 and 1C8) and the output circuit that determines the ball’s
direction of vertical travel (IC5-B).

Suppose the ball is moving upward when it strikes the bottom of
barrier A. According to the table in Fig. 10-13a, this particular
situation should switch the ball’s vertical motion to downward and, at
the same time, score 4 points.

When the ball is moving downward, the pin-5 input of IC4-A is at
logic 1 as explained earlier. And when the ball hits the A barrier (or
any other one for that matter), the HIT input goes to logic 0, and
inverter IC9—A inverts the signal to a positive-going pulse. Since the
hit is not against one of the sides of the playing area, SIDES is at logic
1, and it turns out that all inputs to IC4-A are at logic 1 as long as the
371‘ pulse lasts. This NAND-gate action enables 1C8.

From Fig. 10-8, it can be seen that the A barrier is being drawn
on the screen as long as 128V=0, 64V=1, and 32V=O. These
V-count lines to the select inputs of IC8 cause its pin-11 output to
drop to logic 0, the active-low signal state for the decoders. The
pin-5 output of that same IC is ﬁxed at that same time, so NAN D gate
ICZ-D passes the pin-11 output of ICS as a positive-going pulse.

This pulse is inverted again by inverter IC9-F, and then goes to
the S1 connection on the weighted-scoring circuit. This accounts for
an additional 4 points on the score readout.

That same negative-going pulse from IC9-F also passes
through NAND gate IC3-D, emerging as a positive-going pulse to
the pin-6 input of IC5—B. IC5-B is one-half of an R-S ﬂip-ﬂop circuit
that also includes IC5—A. The positive pulse at IC5-B in this case
resets the ﬂip-ﬂop so that two things happen simultaneously: the
output of IC5-B is switched to logic 0, thereby reversing the direc-
tion of motion of the ball, and the output of IC5-B is switched to logic
0, thereby reversing the direction of motion of the ball, and the
output of IC5-A, is switched to logic 1 to enable the downward-
motion decoder, 1C7.

Recall that this entire sequence of activity began when an
upward-moving ball hit barrier A. The ﬁnal results of this action is 4
additional points in the score and changing the direction of ball motion
from up to down.

A similar kind of analysis shows that the decoders and logic
circuits perform all the direction-changing and scoring operations
speciﬁed in the table on Fig. 10-13a.

All the operations described for the control board to this point
have concerned the VC outputs and changes in the vertical direction.
It can be seen that changes in the horizontal direction of ball motion is
a bit more straightforward.
