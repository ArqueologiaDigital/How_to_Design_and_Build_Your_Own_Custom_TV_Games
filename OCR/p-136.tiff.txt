You must play with this scheme for a while to get a real
understanding of how it works. Keep it simple at ﬁrst, starting with
the circuit in Fig. 4-35, then move on to one that uses two multiplex-
ers for generating the basic ﬁgure and one for determining the
repeated pattern.

It is important to master this technique now. Later chapters
dealing with complete games, and the motion of ﬁgures assume an
understanding of the complex-figure and pattern-generating
schemes.
