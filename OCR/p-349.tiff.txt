puts, the ball travels twice as fast as it does when these circuits are
not selected.

In this particular Golf game, the ball’s speed data is taken from
the 2x vector multiplier circuits until it touches the green. As soon
as the ball touches the green, the speed and direction data is selected
directly from the PHC and PVC inputs, giving the impression the ball
speed is cut in half.

These three sources of speed and direction information—the
stop code, 2x vector speed, and normal speed—are the only ones
used in this particular game. There are provisions on the board,
however, for a fourth option.

The fourth option is a rebound effect that is called up whenever
the ball strikes an obstacle on the course. Since the obstacles are not
included in this game format, the rebound circuitry is not used. A
later chapter, however, takes up the subject of rebound effects, and
the obstacle feature will be added to the Golf game at that time.

For the time being, it is sufficient to say that the ball speed and
direction selectors can take their information from the RHC and
RVC inputs. The obstacle contact input, B0, is normally pulled down
to logic 0 by R1; so as long as no connection is made to that input, the
obstacle rebound inputs (the RHC and RVC inputs) are never
selected.

The circuit in Fig. 8-20 thus has provisions for selecting one of
four sources of speed and direction information, but only three are
used in this version of the Golf game.

The sources of ball speed and direction information that reach
the HC and VC outputs are determined by the BT and BG inputs.
For the present time, the special rebound-selecting input, BO, will
be ignored. The function table in Fig. 8-21 shows the relationship
between the BT and BG inputs and the ball-speed and direction
information selected at the HC and VC outputs. .

Recall that the BT signal is an active-high logic level that stands
at logic 1 as long as the ball—travel timer is activated. This logic-1
level indicates the ball is supposed to be in motion. The ball is not
supposed to be moving as long as BT=O.

The BG input to the control board is a logic level that indicates
Whether or not the ball is on the green. When the ball is NOT on the
green, BG=0, but as soon as the ball makes contact with the green,
BG switches to logic 1.

According to the function table in Fig. 8-21, then, the circuit
selects the slipping-counter stop code (1001) whenever BT=0. The
ball, in other words, should stop moving whenever the ball-travel
timer is not timing 3 SWING operation.
