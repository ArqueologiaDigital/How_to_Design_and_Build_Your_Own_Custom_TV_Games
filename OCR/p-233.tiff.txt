Chapter 7
A Collection of War Games

 

It would be possible to devote at least several more chapters to all
sorts of special game controls, ﬁrst presenting some basic control
circuit and then demonstrating a speciﬁc application. But this is a
good time to change the form of presentation, describing a game
ﬁrst, and then showing some of the special controls it uses.

Although you can certainly build any of the games in this chapter
without referring to anything else in this book but Chapter 2, it would
be wise to complete your study of the entire book ﬁrst.

For instance, you will notice that the ﬁgures used in the war
games described here are more rectangles, and not interesting,
complex ﬁgures. You have the option of using the material in Chapter
4 to generate such ﬁgures from the simpler ones used here.

For the sake of overall simplicity, the games in this chapter do
not include any audio and scoring circuits. These, too, can be added
with great effect later on, but of course, you must complete a study
of the material relating to audio effects and scoring ﬁrst.

And ﬁnally, you ought to be aware of ﬁgure-rotation effects.
None of the ﬁgures in this chapter can be rotated on the screen; so if
you want to add the rotation features, you must study the more
advanced chapter dealing with that particular subject.

Don’t be mislead into thinking the games in this chapter are
overly elementary, however. While these games are, indeed limited
with respect to the ﬁner niceu'es of video-game technology, their
control schemes are as complex and meaningful as any you will ﬁnd
anywhere.
