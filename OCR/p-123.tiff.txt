useful for building a TV game, it certainly illustrates some of the fun
you can have creating Video graphics with this system.

Figure 4—24 illustrated a way to build the image of a cowboy.
The circuit was much simpler in that case, but it was using a’foldover
technique that demanded a symmetrical pattern. The proﬁle in Fig.
4—28b, however, is a nonsymmetrical version of the same hombre.

It is possible to spend many, many hours playing with this
matrix-generating scheme. If you want to make the ﬁgures smaller,
simply scale down the SELECT, WINDOW, and D INPUT specifi-
cations one or two orders of magnitude. Cutting each of the speciﬁ—
cations in half, for instance, cuts the size of the image in half.

Play with this system as long as you want. Just because you are
having fun with it doesn’t mean you aren’t learning anything. Keep
track of your experiments, noting both your failures and successes.
That information will prove invaluable later on.

The extended matrix can be adjusted to form a horizontally
oriented, 16x8 pattern. See the suggested speciﬁcations and pat-
tern in Fig. 4-29.

The display in Fig. 4-30 merely shows one example of how the
16x8 extended matrix can be used. The image in this instance is a
battleship or destroyer. Of course it can be modiﬁed slightly to
transform it into a submarine or aircraft carrier.

This matrix is good for any sort of relatively complex, horizon-
tal, nonsymmetrical ﬁgure.

A 256-Cell, Extended Foldover Matrix

The foldover scheme applied to the 128-cell matrix just de-
scribed yields a 256-cell matrix. The example in Fig. 4-31 shows the
rather simple additional circuin and the left-hand half of an ever—
popular tank image.

When you build the circuit and wire it to the speciﬁcations
shown in Fig. 4-31, you will ﬁnd a full tank image, with its right-hand
half being a mirror image of the portion shown here. It is often
advisable to show only the nonfolded half of such patterns, but for no
reason other than. drawing pictures with 256 cells becomes rather
tedious. Besides, all the necessary information is contained in the
original portion.

MULTIPLYING THE NUMBER OF IDENTICAL IMAGES ON THE SCREEN

While a single complex ﬁgure can play a vital role in most kinds
of TV games, it is often desirable to display a number of identical
complex ﬁgures on the screen. Take for example the mines for a
mineﬁeld game or cars in an auto racing game.
