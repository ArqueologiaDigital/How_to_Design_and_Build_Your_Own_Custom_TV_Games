tively ANDed with the horizontal portion of the image at IC4-B. The
noninverted version of the missile ﬁgure is then inverted by IC6—E
before applying it to other portions of the system.

The circuit in Fig. 7-7 deals mainly with the control aspects of
the attack missile. The launching pulse is formed by ICl-A and IC4-A
in a fashion identical to the launching circuit for the antiballistic
missile. The F3 flip-ﬂop, composed of ICl-B and ICl-C, is set to its
launch condition by the negative-going launch pulse from IC4—A, and
it is reset by a negative—going version of the BRST pulse from the
output of IC4—B.

The initialization-control portion of the attack missile circuit is
embodied in 1C8, actually a quad 2:1 multiplexer. Only two of the
four sections are used here, but that is adequate for shifting the
operation of the slipping-counter board (Fig. 5-15) between the
initializing pulses and motion-generating pulses.

The attack—missile system is initialized as long as the output
from ICl-B is at logic 0, thereby directing vertical-synchronizing
pulses to the VMRST and horizontal-synchronizing pulses to
HMRST inputs of the slipping counter.

The vertical-synchronizing pulses are taken from the initial-
altitude circuit, 1C7 and IC3-A. Switches SC, SD, and SE on Player
B’s control panel determine the pattern of V-count signals that reach
the inputs of IC3-A. The output of IC3-A then determines where
vertical reset for the attack missile takes place on the screen during
reset.

IC3-B determines the horizontal position of the attack missile
through the reset phase of the operation. This is a position that is
ﬁxed by the inverted H-count inputs to IC3-B, a position at the
extreme left-hand edge of the screen. This position-determining
signal from IC3-B is shortened by ICl-D and IC4-F before it is
applied to the initialization— control circuit, 1C8.

As long as the attack missile' is in its reset condition, then the
slipping-counter board holds its position as determined vertically by
the output of IC3- A and horizontally by the output of IC4-F.

When the missile is launched, the output of ICl—B changes to a
logic-1 condition, and the vertical— and ﬁrizontalﬂding signals for
the slipping counter are taken from the VML and HML sources. The
ﬁgure is thus free to move across the screen in a direction and at
rates determined by the VC and HC inputs of the slipping-counter
board.

Player A has access to only the two lower-order speed control
inputs for horizontal and vertical motion. The key to this part of the
circuit lies in the operation of the quad D latch circuit, 1C9. As long as
