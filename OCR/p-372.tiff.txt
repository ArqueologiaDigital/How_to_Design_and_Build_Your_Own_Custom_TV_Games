“dead” stormtrooper, and the multiplexer now sees a logic-0 input at
that position on the screen. The figure for that particular
stormtrooper is thus eliminated until the whole game sequence is
reset again.

As far as the player is concerned, he hopes to hit all eight
stormtroopers before the game is automatically reset. If he is suc-
cessful, the Q outputs of all eight ﬂip-ﬂops are ﬁnally set to logic 0,
and no stormtrooper ﬁgures appear on the screen.
