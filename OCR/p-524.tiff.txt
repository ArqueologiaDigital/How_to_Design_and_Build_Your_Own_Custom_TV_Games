7475* Quad D Latch

DESCRIPTION —The TTL/MSl 9375/5475, 7475 and 9377/5477, 7477
are latches used as temporary storage for binary information between
processing units and input/output or indicator units. information present
at a data (D) input is transferred to the 0 output when the clock is HIGH
and the 0 output will follow the data input as long as the clock remains
HIGH. When the clock goes LOW, the information (that was present at the
data input at the time the transition occurred) is retained at the 0 output
until the clock is permitted to go HlGH.

The 9375/5475, 7475 features complementary O and (-1 output from a 4-bit
latch and is available in the 16-lead packages. For higher component density
applications the 9377/5477, 7477 4-bit latch is available in the 14-Iead
pukage with 5 outputs omitted.
