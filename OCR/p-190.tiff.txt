and the switch is locked out so that the player cannot launch another
rocket for a While.

Now suppose the rocket misses its target and runs to the edge
of the screen. That is the RESET condition in this particular case.
When that happens, the control system initiates a delay interval,
let’s say a delay of 5 seconds. Nothing more can happen until the
delay interval is over, but as soon as that time period lapses, the ﬂow
chart shows that the START switch is unlocked, thereby making it
possible to restart another launch cycle.

Working out a good ﬂow chart for start/ stop controls can save a
lot of hassle, time, and money later on. Time spent working out the
simplest ﬂow chart is thus time well spent. Perhaps equally impor-
tant is the fact that building a ﬂow chart forces you to clarify your
thoughts about what the control system should really do.

After building the ﬂow chart, block out the process, referring to
the control circuits presented in the ﬁrst part of this section. Figure
6-5b shows a block diagram generated from the ﬂow chart.

The system calls for a manual START switch that can be locked
out. The circuit in Fig. 6-20 ﬁts this notion quite well. And since this
particular start circuit generates positive-going pulses, the R-S
ﬂip-ﬂop in Fig. 6—1b falls into place quite naturally. The inverted
output of this ﬂip-ﬂop is then used for locking out the START switch.

The noninverted output of the R-S ﬂip-ﬂop stage enables the
game, whatever that game might be. The exact nature of the game
isn’t relevant to the procedure at hand, but we can assume it
eventually generates a set of parameters that call for resetting the
controls. This reset parameter output from the game can thus
initiate and automatically stop operation. The circuit in Fig. 6—3a ﬁts
the bill in this case.

The negative-going pulse from the auto stop circuit should then
initiate a time delay of 5 seconds, and when that interval has lapsed,
the positive-going pulse from Fig. 6-4 can reset the start-up ﬂip—ﬂop.
The game is thus restarted and the START switch is enabled so the
player can initiate another cycle.

The block diagram in Fig. 6-5b thus transforms the basic ﬂow
chart into a less abstract form. The next step is to make up a
preliminary schematic diagram.

The preliminary schematic shown in Fig. 6-6 merely replaces
the blocks in Fig. 6-5b with the circuits speciﬁed for those blocks.
The primary objective is to see what types of semiconductors are
needed and how many have to be used. There is no real need to
assign pin numbers and component values other than those that are
