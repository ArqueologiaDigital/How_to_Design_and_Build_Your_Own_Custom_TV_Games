important when attempting to build more-complex ﬁgures such as
racing cars, people, airplanes, rockets, tanks, and so on.

To see how the foldover progadure works,_s_tg)pose yo_u have
built a vertical white line using 256H, 128H, 64H, and 32H. As
shown in Fig. 3-15a, these inputs occupy all four inputs of a 4-input
NAND gate on the Tinkerbox assembly. If the output of this gate is
run through an inverter before it is applied to GAME VID IN, it
generates a moderately narrow white line that is just a bit left of
center. See Fig. 3-15b.

Now modify the inputs to the line-generating NAN D gate by
running them through a set of EXCLUSIVE-OR gates (at 7486 quad
2-input EXCLUSIVE-OR). As long as the control input to the 7486
