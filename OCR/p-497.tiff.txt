In this particular example, event A causes the player to hear a
1973-Hz tone that lasts only about 0. 1 second. Event B, on the other
'hand, causes a 987 -Hz tone that lasts about 0.25 second. The overall
effect is a higher-pitched and shorter “plink” sound for event A, and a
lower-pitched and longer “ploonk” sound for event B.

Again, any of the timing values for the monostables and the
V-inputs can be altered to suit your own needs.

Replacing ICZ-B, the output that effectively ORs together the
different tones, with a 4—input NAND gate allows the circuit to
respond to four different kinds of events calling for an equal number
of different tones and tone durations.

Deedie-Deedle Sounds

Space games and ray guns call for weird little sounds that cannot
be easily generated from single V—count sources. They can be
created, however, by rapidly alternating between two different tone
sources. See the example in Fig. 12-4.

ICl-A in Fig. 12- 4 is connected as a free-running multivibrator
having a frequency ﬁxed by the values of R2, R3, and C2. In this
particular case, the frequency is on the order of 4 Hz. This circuit
determines the “deedle-deedle” rate.

The output of ICl-A alternately gates on IC2—C and ICZ-B.
Whenever the output of IC1-A is at logic 1, ICZ-C is gated on,
