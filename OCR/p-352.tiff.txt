popping up at various places in the game area. Scoring is based on
the number of bad guys that are hit during a speciﬁed game-playing
time interval.

This Ambush video game is only slightly different in that the bad
guys shoot back. And if one of these villians hits the good guy (the
player, of course), the game is over.

The unique feature of this game in the context of position
programming is that the positions of the bad guys are purely random.
The position information is selected from a high-speed counter that
is “read” only during a brief time when the game calls for displaying a
new bad guy.

While the playing is rather tricky, Ambush is one of the simplest
games presented in this book. From a hardware point of View, it
requires only two circuit boards and a player control panel.

Figure 8-23 shows the control panel, the panel wiring, and one
example of how the playing area looks.

The player can move the good-guy ﬁgure vertically on the
screen by means of the MOVE control. The player has no control
over the horizontal position of that ﬁgure. It is ﬁxed by the game
logic.

The bad-guy ﬁgure can appear anywhere on the left-hand half of
the screen, and shooting the bad guy is a matter of lining up the
vertical position of the good guy and depressing the FIRE pushbut-
ton. If the two figures aren’t lined up vertically—situated directly
across from one another—when the player depressed the FIRE
button, the shot misses, and the player cannot chalk up a score.

Remember, though, that the bad guy shoots back. Whenever
the game circuitry senses the two ﬁgures are lined up vertically
(presumably because the player is attempting to shoot the bad guy),
there is a ﬁxed 1/10 second delay before the bad guy ﬁres; and if the
good guy hasn’t ﬁred yet and is still in the bad guy’s line of ﬁre, it’s all
over. The bad guy scores a hit and the player must depress the
START button to begin the game all over again.

The general strategy, then, is to shoot at the bad guy while on
the run up or down the screen. Don’t take more than 1/ 10 second to
line up and shoot, or you’ll be dead.

Whenever the player manages to shoot the bad guy, the bad-
guy ﬁgure ﬂashes on the screen for a couple of seconds. The ﬂashing
ﬁgure then disappears from View, immediately being replaced by
another bad guy at some randomly determined position on the
screen. If the bad guy isn’t shot within about 4 seconds, he disap-
pears without ﬂashing, only to be replaced by another somewhere
else on the screen.
