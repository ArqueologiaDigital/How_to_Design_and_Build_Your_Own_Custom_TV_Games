plus a lot, lot more. As shown, the circuit is capable of generating
either a HPP or VPP black bar on the screen, depending on whether
H— or V-count data is applied to the inputs of ICl and 1C2. If these
inputs are from H-count sources 1H through 256H, the circuit
outputs a HPP vertical bar. If the inputs to 1C1 and 1C2 are from the
V—count Sources, it outputs VPP horizontal bars.

1C1 and 1C2 are 4-bit magnitude comparators that are basically
used in the same fashion described earlier in this chapter. IC3 and
1C4, used in conjunction with ﬂip-ﬂop IC5—A, make up a 9-bit pre-
settable up/down binary counter system. These counters, among
other things, can be used for counter-position programming as
described in the previous section.

The table in Fig. 8-10 shows the various operating modes for
the counters and interprets them in terms of position-programmer
functions.

The ﬁrst line of the function table shows a loading function
whereby any 9-bit combination of PD inputs is loaded into the
counters and fed directly to the comparators. If the PD inputs are all
set to logic 0, for instance, this loading operation tells the com-
parators to respond to H- or V—count inputs 0000 0000 0.

As indicated on the ﬁrst line of the function table, the loading
function is established by simply setting the PL input to logic 0. All
other control inputs are then irrelevant. This function is normally
used in conjunction with the program memory function_listed on the
second line. Here the RUN input is ﬁxed at logic 1 and PL is retumed'
to logic 1. Any 9-bit combination of logic levels loaded into the
counters and _(_:_omparators while PL is at logic 0 is then remem-
bered” when PL is set to logic 1. You can change the PD inputs and
clock the circuit if you want, but the stored data will remain in the
system as long as RUN=1 and PL=1. This sort of register of
memory function is not readily available with any of the other
position-programming schemes described to this point.

Before investigating the real implications of this combination of
loading and memory functions, it would be a good idea to preview the
other two possible operating modes, the ones listed on the last two
lines of the function table. _

The system is taken from its loading mode by setting PL to 1,
and then it can be taken from its memory mode by setting RUN to
logic 0. With RUN =0 and PL=1, the counters can be incremented or
decremented by pulses at the MCLK input. Whether the counters
increment (up count) or decrement (down count) depends on the
logic level at DIR. If DIR=O, the counters clock upward, but if
DIR=1, the counters clock downward. ‘
