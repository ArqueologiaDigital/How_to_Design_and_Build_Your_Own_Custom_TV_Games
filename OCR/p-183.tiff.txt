will appear at the output of this circuit, but it is effectively “ﬁltered”
by the ﬂip-ﬂop stage that follows it.

Since the signal from the circuit in Fig. 6-2a is an active—low,
START level, it can be directly connected to the START input of the
ﬂip-ﬂop in Fig. 6-1a.

The start circuit in Fig. 6-2b is a bit more complicated. In this
case, however, depressing the START button generates a START
pulse having a duration roughly equal to the time constant of R2 and
C1. The button must be released before it is possible to generate
another START pulse.

This circuit will show some contact-bouncing effects, but again,
the ﬂip—ﬂop following that stage Will eliminate these undesirable
effects. The active-low nature of the pulse from this start circuit
makes it directly compatible with the ﬂip-ﬂop in Fig. 6-1a.

The start circuit in Fig. 6-2c uses a 555-type timer to generate
the START pulse. If the LOCK input is ﬁxed at logic 1, this circuit
generates a clean, positive-going pulse each time the START button
