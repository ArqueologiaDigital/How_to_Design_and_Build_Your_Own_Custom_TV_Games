Fig. 8-1 . Pinout and operating features of the 74854-Bit magnitude comparator.

When these two 4-bit numbers are applied to their respective
inputs of the comparator, one of the three outputs switches to a
logic-1 level. If the two numbers are exactly equal, output A=B goes
to logic 1. If number A happens to be greater than B (A=1001 and
B=0101, for example), output A > B goes to logic 1. And ﬁnally, if
input A is less than B, output A < B goes to logic 1.

The cascading inputs are used only when the comparator IC is
being used with an identical unit to compare words having eight or
more bits. Otherwise, cascading input A=B should be connected to
logic 1, and the inequality cascading inputs should both be grounded.
Circuits in the following sections of this chapter illustrate all these
operating modes.

A PROGRAMMABLE FIGURE POSITION CONTROL

Chapter 3 deals with the basic circuitry for generating lines,
bars, and rectangles on the screen. The logic—circuit designs in those
instances determine both the size and position of the ﬁgures. Such
ﬁgures can be placed anywhere on the screen by using the appro-
priate set of H- and V-count inputs from the Sourcebox, but once
they are ﬁxed, it is difﬁcult to change them on a ﬁnished circuit board.

The circuit described here is generally more complicated than
any in Chapter 3, but it is rather easy to change the parameters
