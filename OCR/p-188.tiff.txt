the ball until the next serve begins.

Figure 6-4 shows a relaible time delay circuit. In this instance, a
negative-going pulse at pin 6 of ICl—A initiates a monostable timing
interval equal to 1.1 times the product of R1 and C1. When that
interval is over, capacitor C2 passes a negative-going pulse to the
trigger input of ICl-B which, in turn, generates a 10-ms positive
pulse.

The positive pulse from ICl-B thus occurs at the end of the time
delay interval, an interval set by the time constant of ICl-A.

The timing can be initiated by any of the start or stop circuits
described thus far in this chapter, provided the trigger input of ICl-A
sees a negative-going or active-low pulse that has a duration less
than the time constant of R1 and C1.

The whole timing operation can be locked out by pulling the
LOCK terminal (pin 4 of ICl-A) to logic 0. This terminal must be
connected to +5V if the lockout feature is not to be used.

A Design Example

Before leaving the subject of start/ stop controls, it is important
to take a close look at how these circuits can be combined to yield the
desired control effect. There are countless possibilities, using just
the circuits described here. If you are willing to add a few more gates
and passive components, you will ﬁnd you are in a position to create
just about any sort of control scheme you will ever want.

The following discussion is intended to lead the reader through
a control design procedure, step by step. Although the discussion is
built around one particular example, the methods employed can be
applied to any sort of design situation for game controls.

The ﬁrst step is to determine precisely what the control
scheme is supposed to do. A ﬂow chart is helpful here. The ﬂow
chart in Fig. 6-5a illustrates the operation of a start/stop control
scheme that has the following characteristics.

The player is to initiate a game or game cycle by depressing a
START pushbutton. As soon as the button is depressed, it should be
locked out until the cycle is completed. The ﬂow chart thus shows a
manual start operation at the beginning of the cycle, followed im-
mediately by a switch lockout operation.

As the START switch is locked out, the game begins. It isn’t
important What the game is at this point. Whatever the game might
do, there always comes a time when it should be reset. Suppose, for
example, the START switch launches a rocket ﬁgure on the screen.
The moment the switch is depressed, the rocket begins to move,
