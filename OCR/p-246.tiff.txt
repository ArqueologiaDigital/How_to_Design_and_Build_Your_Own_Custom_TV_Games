three just mentioned and a slipping-counter board from Fig. 5—15. Of
course there are two separate control panels that have already been
described in Figs. 7-2 and 7-3.

After studying the game’s ﬂow chart and block diagrams in
some detail, there is little need for a highly detailed description of the
circuits themselves. The overall wiring block diagram in Fig. 7—9 will
prove invaluable when analyzing the operation of the system at the
circuit-board level.

Figure 7-6 shows a board containing most of the control ele-
ments for the antiballistic missile system. ICs l-A and 6-F, along
with C1 and R7, merely transform the negative-going launch sig_na_l_
into a brief, negative- -going pulse. IC2-A and ICZ- C make up the R- S
ﬂip-ﬂop that 15 set so that pin 3 15 at logic 1 and pin 815 at logic 0
whenever that pulse occurs.

10s 2— B, 2- D, and 1- B make up the initialization control circuit.
Whenever the antiballistic missile is in its reset position, this circuit
delivers an inverted VRST pulse to the loading input of the vertical-
slipping counter, 1C7, and 1C8. Whenever the missile is launched,
however, the initialization-control circuit delivers the output of
ICl-D back to the load input of the slipping counter.

The four sections of 1C3 determine the pattern of inverted and
noninverted H—count signals for determining the initial horizontal
position of the antiballistic missile. See details in connection with the
circuit in Fig. 6-17. These position-determining signals pass directly
through IC9, a quad D latch, as long as the system Is in its reset
condition and the LOAD button 13 depressed. 101- A 1s _responsible
for AN Dmg the launch status information from the R- S flip-ﬂop and
the POS logic level from the player’s LOAD button.

Whenever the LOAD button is released or the missile is
launched, pins 4 and 13 of IC9 go to logic 0, thereby placing the
latches into their memory modes. The horizontal-position data that
existed the moment the circuit is latched then remains ﬁxed at the
inputs of IC5-A.

The position of the antiballistic missile in the horizontal plane is
actually deﬁned by IC5-A. Since this pluse is too Wide for generating
the horizontal width of the antiballistic missile, it is shorted in the
circuit made up of IC1-C, IC6-C, R6, and C2. The value of C2 can be
changed to suit the designer’s own impression of how wise the
antiballistic missile ﬁgure ought to be.

The height and vertical position of the antiballistic missile are
both determined by the pin-12 output of the higher-order vertical-
slipping counter, 1C8. This output is inverted by IC6-D and effec-
