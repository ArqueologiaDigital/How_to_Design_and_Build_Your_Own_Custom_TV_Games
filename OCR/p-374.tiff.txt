design a game having this special ﬁgure-eliminating feature—an
elementary memory system—ought to build this game and work
through the circuitry first hand.

The Control board in Fig. 8-32 handles most of the control
functions for the Stormtrooper Attack game. Whenever the game is
in progress, for instance, ICl—A senses an alignment between the
horizontal components of the good guy and any one of the
stormtroopers visible on the screen. Whenever this sort of align-
ment occurs, a negative-going pulse from ICl-A initiates a 0.1-
second monostable timer, ICS-A. And when this short timing inter-
val elapses, the output at pin 5 of ICS—A initiates yet another timing
operation from IC8-B. The timing interval in this case is close to 0. 5
second.

What is the purpose of these sequential timers? These timers
are responsible for making the stormtroopers ﬁre at the good guy
whenever he crosses the path of any one of them. The ﬁrst timer
inserts the crucial 0.1-second delay that gives the good guy a chance
to ﬁre a round and get out of the way. ICS—B then times the interval
the stormtroopers’ ray beam appears on the screen.

Both of tthe stormtrooper beam timers are disabled
whenever the CLR signal to them is at logic 0. This particular
condition occurs between the time the game is automatically reset
and the player depresses the START button. The stormtroopers, in
other words, cannot ﬁre at the good guy until the game is started,
thus giving the good guy a chance to take his initial defensive position
without getting blasted off the screen before the attack really starts.
Be careful, though. The stormtroopers might ﬁre a volley the instant
the game is started.

The pulse-generator circuit composed of ICl-B and IC6-A ﬁxes
the width of the stormtroopers beam. The width of the beam can be
selected by the value of C4, the larger the value, the wider the beam.

This pulse generator~ is put into action on the negative-going
(leading) edge of every SH pulse from the multiplexer circuit in Fig.
8-31. The beam, in other words, always appears to come from the
left—hand edge of an advancing stormtrooper ﬁgure. Thus the
stormtroopers are all right-handed, a fact that might help the good
guy’s strategy.

The R-S flip-ﬂop made up of ICl-C and ICl-D determines
where the stormtroopers’ beams begin and end. The SV signal to
one of the inputs to this ﬂip—ﬂop ensures that the beam always starts
from the line of stormtroopers, and the VRST input makes certain
the beams travel all the way to the bottom of the screen.
