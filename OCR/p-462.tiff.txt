There is some ﬁgure distortion introduced in these images, but
it turns out that the distortion is far more apparent when viewing the
static frames than when they are in motion on the screen.

The approach to designing a circuit for this animation sequence
is identical to that of the 4-frame walking sequence described earﬁor
in this chapter:

1. Draw the basic ﬁgure sequence in standard matrix formats
(Fig. 11-5).

2. Reduce the number of images, if possible, by noting
whether any are simple mirror images of others.

3. Assign logic levels to_the nonextended portion of the mat-
rices, using an X or X to indicate the third-order H-count
(Fig. 11-6a).

4. Note any D inputs that show identical combinations of

inputs through all the frames (Fig. 11-6b).

Prepare a truth table for each class of D inputs (Fig. 11-6c).

Devise logic circuits for solving the truth table.

Complete the circuit design and assign H- and V-count

.- parameters for ﬁgure size and position on the screen (Fig.
11-7).

It can be seen from the drawings in Fig. 11-5 that half the
ﬁgures are mirror images of others. Frame 8, for instance, is a
vertical mirror image of frame 1, and so are frames 7 and 2, 6 and 3,
and 5 and 4. There are thus only four unique frames to be generated
by an 8 x8 extended matrix generator. The mirror-image frames are
generated from the same data circuitry, but with the H-count ad—
dresses running backward instead of forward.

Figure 11-6a shows the logic levels assigned to the matrix
generator’s D inputs for the four basic frames, while the equations in
Fig. 11-6b show those D inputs that are the same.

Figure 11-6c summarizes the representative D inputs that
require something other than constant 0, 1, or X. It shows, in other
words, those D inputs calling for some sort of logic manipulation
between the four basic frames.

Now it is time to appreciate the operation of the dual 2-line-te-
4—line decoder described in Fig. 11-1. Note the sequence in Fig.
11~6c for D0, D8, D16, and D24. Grouping them together yields a
pattern of logic levels that closely resembles the truth tables in Fig.
11-1. These D inputs to the matrix generator can be derived directly
from a 4-line decoder by applying B0 and B1 to the select inputs, A
and B respectively, feeding the four 2Y outputs through inverters,
and applying X to the C2 input. See this done with IC3—A in Fig. 11-7.
