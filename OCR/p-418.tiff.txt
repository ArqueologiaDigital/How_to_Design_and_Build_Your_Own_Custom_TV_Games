ﬁgure that is made movable from a motion—control circuit. The
outputs of the three ﬁgure generators are combined in the game
video circuit to produce a video output for displaying them on the TV
screen.

Whenever the ball ﬁgure and top ﬁgure meet, however, the
TOP HIT block generates a logic level that sets the ball’s motion—
control circuit for downward motion. Presumably the ball then
moves in a downward direction until it contacts the bottom ﬁgure. At
that moment, the BOTTOM HIT block generates a logic level that
makes the motion control circuit move the ball ﬁgure upward.

The ball can thus bounce up and down between the top and
bottom ﬁgures at a rate determined by the hall’s velocity and the
spacing between the ﬁxed lines.

Of course the same general idea applies to horizontal ball
motion, substituting left and right ﬁxed ﬁgures for the top and
bottom ones, and using a horizontal-motion-control circuit. Figure
10-2, however, shows the circuitry for the vertical ball-bouncing
circuit.

The ball ﬁgure in this instance is a simple 4H x 4V square, and
the ﬁxed ﬁgures are white lines near the top and bottom of the
screen. The horizontal position of the ball ﬁgure is ﬁxed near the
center of the screen by the 128H signal being fed to a negative—edge
