connected from that input point and the GAME VID IN terminal on
the Sourcebox, the screen will show the usual 256H pattern.

But once that same signal passes through the NAN D gate, the
blacks and whites are reversed. In digital terms, a NAN D gate with a
single input works like a logic inverter—it reverses the logic-1 and -0
levels.

The signal from the NAND gate is then passed through an
inverter circuit where the waveform is reversed once again. This
operation brings the signal back to its original phase, thus creating an
image on the screen that is in all respects the same as that created by
the original 256H waveform.

Any horizontal- or vertical-count waveform can be applied to
the input of the circuit in Fig. 3—43, and emerge in its original form
from the output of the inverter circuit, ICl—A.
