If from the top, use 64V___
If from the bottom, use 64V
3. Is the resulting white bar to be further narrowed from the
top or bottom?
If from the top, use 32V___
If from the bottom, use 64V

Continue using more V inputs, in decreasing sequence, until the
desired horizontal line width and position is achieved. Bear in mind
that including another inverted V input narrows the white bar from
the bottom, while including another noninverted V input narrows the
bar from the top.

While experimenting with this general procedure for building
vertical or horizontal lines, you might have noticed what happens
whenever you skip over one of the lower—order signals. Try it. You
will find that skipping one input in the normal sequence of high-to-
lower-order inputs causes a pair of parallel lines to appear on the
screen. Take note of this fact because it might be helpful to you later
on.

BUILDING WIDELY SEPARATE!) PARALLEL LINES AND BARS

Single white vertical or horizontal lines might be useful for
certain game designs, but it is more often desirable to create a pair of
widely separated parallel lines. A case in point concerns building the
border lines for many playing-ﬁeld type games. Such a border can be
built from a combination of widely separated horizontal and vertical
lines.

Building a four-sided border ﬁgure is getting ahead of the
discussion, however. You must ﬁrst learn how to put a pair of parallel
lines of any desired width and spacing you choose on the screen.

This procedure involves three basic steps. First, use the
NAND/invert scheme on the Tinkerbox to create one of the two
lines. Note the required inputs, then use the same circuit to create
the second line. Finally, reduce the two circuits to their simplest
possible circuit form and combine them in a Tinkerbox ORing circuit.
Use the diagrams in Fig. 3-6 as a reference for studying and experi-
menting with this procedure in greater detail.

Suppose you want to place two parallel vertical lines on the
screen. The two lines can have any desired width and relative
position.

Begin by building one of the two lines, using the NAND/invert
circuit shown in Fig. 3-6a. Do this by using the Recipe for a Vertical
Line or Bar described earlier in this chapter.
