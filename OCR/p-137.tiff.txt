Building Motion-Control Circuits

 

Motion makes TV games. Without some player-controlled and au-
tomatic motion, today’s video game business would not exist. Given
the choice between a system that only generates complex static
ﬁgures and one that generates very simple ﬁgures that move, most
people would choose the system that includes the motion feature.

The ﬁgures for the original table tennis, squash, and hockey
games were exceedingly simple—merely rectangles and lines. But
the player-controlled paddle motion and the automatic ball motion
gives these games their real appeal. No one seems to care whether
the ball is round or square. Motion makes the game.

You can build some good video games around the player—
controlled and automatic motion circuits described in this chapter.
There is no real need to generate the complex ﬁgures featured in
Chapter 4. ‘

At some point in your experience with custom video games,
however, you will most likely ﬁnd that adding one or two complex
ﬁgures makes the games more fun and interesting.

Work through the descriptions and experiments in this chapter,
carefully noting the special features of each one. There are a number
of options offered here, and that implies that some motion-control
circuits are better than others under certain circumstances.

Get a good understanding of all the motion circuits now, and you
will be able to design more effective and efﬁcient game circuits later
on.
