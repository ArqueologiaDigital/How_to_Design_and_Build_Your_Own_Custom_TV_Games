at logic 1. And as long as ICZ-A is thus passing the good-guy ﬁgure,
that ﬁgure is ORed with the other game components at IC5-A.

The pin-1 input of ICZ-A drops to logic 0 and blanks the good-
guy ﬁgure from the screen whenever he is hit by a beam from one of
the stormtroopers. To see how this blanking feature works, ngtg
that the pin-1 input of IC2-A is controlled by the output 3f_ a R-S
ﬂip-ﬂop,IC3-A and IC3-B. A logic-0 input to IC3-B from CLR sets
this ﬂip-ﬂop into a condition that places a logic-1 level at pin 1 of
IC2-A, allowing the good guy ﬁgure to appear on the screen. The
good guy, in other words, always appears on the screen whenever
the game is started.

The good guy is blanked from the screen whenever the pin-1
input of IC3-A goes to logic 0. This happens only when one of the
stormtroopers manages to kill the good guy. Recall that ICl-A
senses an alignment between the horizontal components of one of
the stormtroopers and the good guy. This logic-0 signal goes to pin 2
of IC7—A where it is effectively ANDed with the stormtrooper beam
signal from IC4-A. If the stormtrooper beam and alignment of the
good guy and a stormtrooper occur at the same time, the output of
IC7—A goes to logic 1. _ _.

IC6—F inverts this good-guy-hit signal and sets the R—S flip-ﬂop
to a condition that blanks good guy from the screen. Once the game
is started, good guy remains visible on the screen until he is hit by a
stormtrooper’s beam. If the good guy manages to avoid being hit, his
ﬁgure remains on the screen throughout the game.

The stormtroopers’ horizontal- and vertical-ﬁgure compo-
nents, SH and SV, are combined at IC7-C and blanked at the
appropriate time by IC7-C. The stormtrooper video signal is then
applied to IC5—A, where it is combined with the beams and good-guy
ﬁgure.

Live stormtroopers are blanked off the screen whenever the
good guy ﬁres a round. Note that GF P, the good-guy ﬁring signal, is
applied to one input of 1C7 -C, creating a logic—1 level that blanks the
stormtrooper ﬁgures as long as the 0. 5-second good-guy beam lasts.
The visual impression is that the stormtroopers take cover every
time the good guy ﬁres. Good guy can stillhit one of the troopers,
even while taking cover, though.

ICS-B is responsible for sensing a hit between the good guy’s
ﬁring beam and a stormtrooper. This NAN D gate merely senses the
simultaneous occurrence of horizontal alignment and the good guy’s
ﬁring pulse. The resulting HIT signal is used for blanking the strick-
en stormtrooper from the screen for the reaminder of the attack
