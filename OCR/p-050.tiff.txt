rows the bar from the left-hand side, while adding an inverted
version of the next-lower-order H input narrows the bar from the
right. There is no reason why you cannot use combinations of
inverted and noninverted H inputs to place a white bar in virtually any
position in the white ﬁeld of the basic 2‘56ﬁ pattern. And if you want
the bar to appear on the left-hand side of the screen, begin with 256H
instead of 256H. Furthermore, you can set the width of the white bar
by the number of H inputs you use: the larger the number of
H-count inputs, the narrower the bar becomes.

Now you are in a position to try some design work of your own.
Remove all inputs to the NAND gate and use a grease pencil to mark
a point on the TV screen where you want a vertical line to appear.
Indicate the desired width too.

Apply the 256H signal to the NAND gate. If your mark is in the
white area, that is the proper input signal. If your mark is in the black
area, however, you must apply 256H to the NAND gate (by running
it through an inverter before applying it to the NAN D gate).

Once you have the mark in a white ﬁeld, add 1281-1 to the NAN D
gate. Again, if the mark appears in the resulting White ﬁeld, you are
ready to add the next-lower-order signal, but if it is in a black area,
128H must be run through an inverter before applying it to the
NAND gate.

Continue this procedure, adding successively lower-order H
inputs, inverting them when necessary, until the resulting white bar
has the position and width you indicated with the grease pencil on the
screen. Allowing a small percentage of placement error, you will be
able to place a single vertical line of any desired width anywhere on
the screen.

This entire process can be summarized as a recipe for building a
vertical line or bar, using the NAN D/invert circuit on the Tinkerbox
assembly.

Recipe for a Vertical Line or Bar

Begin with a white screen, assuming it is actually a full-screen
vertical bar.

1. Is that big bar to be narrowed in from the left or right?

If from the left, use 256H
If from the right, use 256H

2. Is the resulting white bar to be further narrowed from the
left or right?
If from the left, use 128i
If from the right, use 128H
