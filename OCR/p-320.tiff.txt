game sets the counters’ outputs to zero and fixes the position of a
ﬁgure at some particular place on the screen. When that phase of the
game is completed, a clock pulse advances the counters, thereby
changing the position information and, ultimately, the position of the
ﬁgure on the screen.

This counter input scheme has a wide variety of possible con-
ﬁgurations, and the one shown here speciﬁes position information
for just two 4-bit magnitude comparitors, 1C1 and 1C2. The whole
business can be expanded to accommodate the more complex and
complete position programmers in Figs. 8-4 and 8-5.

1C1 in Fig. 8-7 compares only the four higher—order bits from
the H-count section of the Sourcebox. The horizontal bar it gener-
ates is thus ﬁxed at the 32H width. By the same token, 1C2 com-
pares only 16V, 32V, 64V, and 128V from the Sourcebox unit,
thereby generating a VPP signal that is 16V wide. Let me repeat that
the comparator circuitry can be expanded to handle eight or nine
signals from both the H- and V-count outputs from the Sourcebox.
The idea is limited to four each in this case to (1) make the discussion
simpler and (2) make the point that one does not have to use a full 8-
or 9—bit comparison to do every sort of pattern-programming job.

The counters, sources of positioning information, are 1C3 and
1C4 in Fig. 8-7. The counters are cascaded so that they can count
anywhere from 0000 0000 (decimal zero) through 1111 1111 (deci-
mal 255). There are thus 256 possible combinations of positioning
information for the comparators. Any number of counters can be
cascaded in this fashion to accommodate an equal number of inputs to
an expanded comparator scheme.

The] terminals indicate hard—wire jumper positions. The state
of the counters determine the sequence of positions, but the jumper
wires connected between the output of the counters and the inputs
of the comparitors determine what those positions will be.

Capacitors C1 and C2 are merely de-glitching capacitors that
eliminate any transient spikes generated by this particular type of
counter circuit.

The ﬁgures in the inserts in Fig. 8-7 suggest some ways for
controlling the counters. The manual clock option provides a simple
and reliable means for debouncing a manual pushbutton input. Each
time the CLK pushbutton is depressed, a monostable multivibrator,‘
built around 1C5, generates a 10-ms pulse that advances the coun-
ters.

The normally closed pushbutton in the manual clear option can
be depressed to clear both counters to their initial zero conﬁgura-
tion.
