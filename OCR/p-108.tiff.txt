breadboard arrangement, then use the speciﬁcations shown in Fig.
4-18 to generate an extended 8x8 matrix.

After assembling this particular circuit (using the speciﬁcations
in Fig. 4-18, but leaving all the D inputs unconnected) you should see
a white square pattern on the screen.

Connecting any one of the D inputs to logic 0 then creates a little
black square at the corresponding matrix position. From this point,
you can generate any complex ﬁgure you choose, using the same
general procedures outlined for the 32-cell extended-matrix circuits.

Figure 4-19 shows the speciﬁcations for generatingthe ﬁgure of
a little dog. This nonsymmetrical ﬁgure has far more detail than is
possible with any of the ﬁgure-generating circuits described in the
ﬁrst part of this chapter. And of course that is the whole point of
using this more complex matrix-generator circuit.

While working with this extended 8 X8 matrix pattern, bear in
mind that your select speciﬁcations determine the size of the matrix,
the window speciﬁcations determine the position on the screen, and
the D inputs determine the pattern itself.

You can have a lot of fun generating your own ﬁgures within this
matrix. Spend a great deal of time playing with it, sharpening your
ability to generate any desired ﬁgure as quickly and effectively as
possible. Time spent on the project at this point will pay off big
