you will ﬁnd the line is now 4H wide. Its position is then programmed
by inputs 4P through 256P.

The width of the line can thus be adjusted or programmed by
connecting lower-order program inputs to their respective H—count
inputs: IP to 1 and 1H, 2P to 2 and 2H, 4P to 4 and 4H, and so on.
The more program inputs wired in this fashion, the wider the line.
The position of that line is then adjusted by the higher-order program
inputs not connected to their respective H-count sources.

As a design example, suppose you want a vertical line 16H Wide
just left of center of the screen. The NAND-gate speciﬁcations from ‘
Chapter 3 would be 256H, 128H, and 64H, but in this case, the
speciﬁcations are as follows: 1P=1=1H, 2P=2=2H, 4P=4=4H,
and 8P=8=8H. To be sure, the comparator scheme calls for more
more circuitry (the circuit in Fig. S-Za as opposed to a simple 3-input
NAND gate), but the advantage is that the size and position of the
line can be changed by simply altering the P inputs. And as described
later in this chapter, the P inputs can be altered by other circuitry—
the size and position of the line can be changed automatically. That is
virtually impossible with the NAND-gate line-generating scheme in
Chapter 3.

After experimenting with the circuit in Fig. 8— 2a for a while, you
will ﬁnd you can generate sets of parallel lines by ﬁxing certain
program inputs to one particular logic level and connecting the P
inputs on either side of it to their respective H-count signals.

All of this applies equally well when orienting the comparator
circuit around the V—count inputs. Figure 8-2b shows a pair of
comparator circuits in block diagram form. The circuits are identical
in every respect. The one generating horizontal parameters, how-
ever, takes its Sourcebogﬁputs from the nine H-count lines and
generates an active low HPP signal. The block generating vertical
data ____takes its Sourcebox information from V- count and generates a
VPP output signal.

The simple circuits in Fig. 8—3 show several suggested
techniques for combinirithe hgiz_ontal- and vertical-equality sig-
nals. In Fig. 8-3a, the HPP and VPP signals are effectively ANDed
together to yield a white rectangle. The size and position of this
rectangle is determined by the horizontal- and vertical-program
inputs.

The circuit in Fig. 8-3b uses a pair of pulse generators to
overcome a certain disadvantage inherent in the simple ANDing
operation of Fig. 8-3a. Using the bar-positioning scheme described
earlier in this section, you will ﬁnd that it is difﬁcult to position larger
bars or rectangles exactly where you want them. A bar that is 64H
