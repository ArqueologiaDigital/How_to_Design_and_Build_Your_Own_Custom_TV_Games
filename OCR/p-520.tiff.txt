7448* BOD to 7-Segment Converter

DESCRIPTION - The 9358/5448, 7448 and 9359/5449, 7449'are TTL,
ECU to 7-Segment Decoders consisting of NAND gates, input buffers and
seven AND-OR-INVERT gates. The 9358/5448, 7448 offers active HIGH,
open-collector outputs for current-sourcing applications to drive logic
circuits or discrete, active components. Seven NAND gates and one driver
are connected in pairs to make BCD data and its complement available
to the seven decoding AND-OR-INVERT gates. The remaining NAND gate
and three input buffers provide Iemp test, blanking input/rippIe-blanking
output and ripple-blanking input for the 9358/5448, 7448. Four NAND
gates and four input buffers provide BCD data and its complement and a
buffer provides blanking input for the 9359/5449, 7449.

The circuits accept 4-bit binary-coded—decimal (BCD) and, depending on
the state of the auxiliary inputs, decodes this data to drive other compon-
ents. The relative positive~logic output levels, as well as conditions required
at the auxiliary inputs are shown in the truth tables.

The 9358/5448, 7448 circuit incorporates automatic leadﬂr‘g and/or trailing
edge zero-blanking control lR—B—l and r30). Lamp test (LT) of these types
may be performed at any time when the Film node is a HIGH level. They
contain an overriding blanking input (El) which can be used to control the
lamp intensity or to inhibit the outputs.
