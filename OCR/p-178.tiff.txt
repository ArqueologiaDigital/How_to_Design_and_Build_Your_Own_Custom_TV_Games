To make a long story short, 1C6 responds to the one line during
VBLANK where 1V, 2V, 4V, and 8V all at logic 1 at the same time. It
is only during this one particular line that the horizontal-slipping
counter can count a cycle that is longer or shorter than the stop-code
cycle.

Now suppose you have set the HC inputs of the slipping counter
to 1000, a code that makes the counter run one extra pulse. When
that one critical scan line occurs during the VBLANK, the counter
long-counts to set the reset point one HCLK pulse to the right. The
system then automatically injects the stop code, creating a motion-
less vertical line that is shifted one HCLK interval to the right of
where it was on the previous frame. Since this shifting takes place
once during each frame, the vertical bar moves gradually to the
right, one HCLK interval per frame, or 60 HCLK intervals per
second.

Motion to the left is accomplished in much the same fashion,
except the slipping counter is forced to short—count during that one
critical line in the VBLANK interval. The table accompanying the
schematic diagram in Fig. 5-14 summarizes the horizontal-motion
codes for this system.

Construct the circuit in Fig. 5-14 and try it for yourself. You can
create logic-0 at the HC inputs by connecting the points to COMM.
You can create a logic-1 input by connecting a jumper to +5V, but
that isn’t really necessary with these TTL circuits, because no
connection at all lets the inputs assume a logic-1 condition.

You can use any one of the HM outputs for this experiment,
simply connecting one of them to GAME VID IN. The MM (max/
min) output of 1C2 makes a nice take-off point for a video signal too.

A Complete SIipping-Counter-Motion-Control Board

The vertical— and horizontal-slipping—counter circuits can be
easily assembled on a single PC card, providing the experimenter
with a universal digital-motion card. This card can be used for
experiments aimed at getting a better understanding of slipping-
counter motion control. But equally important, it can be used as a
motion control board for any number of TV game circuits. A bit of
time and effort invested in such a board will pay big dividends later in
your work.

The universal slipping-counter motion board, shown in Fig.
5-15, has provisions for digitally controlling the speed and direction
of both vertical and horizontal motion. Input connections to the
Sourcebox unit include HCLK, HBLANK, HRST, VBLANK, and
