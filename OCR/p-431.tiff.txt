Even after going through all these D-input, addressing, and
windowing steps, the ﬁgure information coming from the pin-10
output of IC7 only vaguely resembles that shown in Fig. 10-8a. Aside
from being inverted (blacks and whites reversed) this output shows
groups of 32H x 32V squares instead of 4V lines. What remains to
be done to complete the ﬁgure-generating process is to invert the
logic and narrow all the ﬁgures to 4V.

IC2-B in Fig. 10-9 uprights the contrast between blacks and
whites, while the inputs to IC3-A narrow the ﬁgures to 4V. The
ﬁgure information from 1C2 B is thus NANDed with EV, W, and4 —V
to trim down the height of each element In the playing area to a 4V
level whenever 16V shows a change from 1 to O.

The white sides of the ﬁgure are added at 1C3 B to create the
basic pinball game ﬁgure. Narrowing the white top and bottom
edges, ﬁxed barriers, and paddles to 4V is the unique part of the
operation. The rest of it comes from material already outlined in
Chapter 4.

The little ball ﬁgure is generated by the pulse circuits composed
of ICl-C, ICl-D, IC4—A, and IC4-C. It is assembled into a square by
IC4-B. The original information for creating this movable ball ﬁgure
comes from a slipping-counter board generating the necessary
256HM and 128VM signals.

The BALL signal from IC4—B is used for control as well as
ﬁgure-generating purposes. ICZ-A, for instance, NANDs the ball
image with data from the main ﬁgure generator to produce a HIT
pulse, a pulse that signals a contact between the ball and any of the
main ﬁgures in the playing area.

The ball ﬁgure is to be blanked from the screen whenever it is
not in play, so there is a need for a ball-blanking circuit built around
NAN D gate IC2-C. The unblanked ball ﬁgure is then combined with
the main playing ﬁgure in IC2-D, and this composite game ﬁgure is
ﬁnally combined with the scoring data in IC5-D.

IC5—D, another EXCLUSIVE OR gate, makes the ball count
and scoring ﬁgures appear black on the white areas to the left and
right of the main playing area.

The purpose of the hall’s control signals and the origin of the
SCO (scoring data) and BBLANK (ball blanking) signals will be
described later.

Before leaving this discussion of the ﬁgure board, however, we
must point out the origin of the ET and ITT- signals from IC8—B and
IC8-C respectively. These two signals represent the two sides of
the main playing area, and are ultimately used for setting the
horizontal-rebounding directions for the ball ﬁgure.
