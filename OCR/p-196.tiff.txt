you begin moving your car faster than the others—one little slip and
whamol—you brush against one of the other cars, there is an
explosion, and the game is reset so that you have to start all over
again.

One of the key operations in this particular example is sensing
contact with one of the other racing-car ﬁgures. What happens after
that depends on the kind of control circuitry you devise. The impor-
tant thing right now is providing a means for sensing a critical contact
between two or more ﬁgures on the screen.

The ﬁgures on the screen are generally generated separately,
using the schemes already outlined in Chapters 3 and 4. The images
are ORed together to produce a composite video signal. Contact
sensing must take place ahead of the last ORing operation, and it is
basically an AN Ding logic operation.

The little circuit in Fig. 6-8a shows how this contact—sensing
AND operation can be applied when the ﬁgure generators output
active-low (black-on-White) data. In this case, both inputs must be at
logic 0 before the NOR gate outputs a logic-1 contact signal. This is
an active-low, or negative-logic, AND operation. Whenever the
images for A and B are not in contact with one another, the CON
output in Fig. 6-8a rests at logic 0. When images A and B touch one
another, however, the CON output begins generating positive-going
pulses at the horizontal scan rate of the system (about 15, 750 Hz).

The circuit in Fig. 6-8b shows how the contact-sensing circuit
can be implemented. Images A and B are generated by the approp-
riate combinations of H- and V—count data applied to the inputs of
ICl-A and ICl-B respectively. The outputs of these two NAND
gates represent inverted, or black-on-white, versions of images A
and B. These images are then ORed by means of a NAND gate,
ICZ-A. (Remember that inverted signals applied to a NAND gate
yields an ORing effect.) The GAME VID output thus contains the
video information for presenting both images A and B on the screen.

The inputs to IC3-A, however, are taken directly from the two
image-generating NAN D gates. IC3—A is the contact sensing circuit
already described in connection with Fig. 6-8a. Whenever images A
and B touch one another on the screen, their video data is lining up
such that the CON output is showing positive active-high pulses.
These pulses cannot occur at any other time.

In short, the circuit in Fig. 6-8b generates video information for
two different images, combines them into a single composite game
video signal and senses any contact between the two images.

The circuit in Fig. 6-8c performs the same function as that in
Fig. 6—8a. In this latter example, however, the video data for the two
