14-MHz pulses from the oscillator operate a 9-bit binary counter that
ultimately yields the 15,750-Hz pulses required for horizontal syn-
chronization. During the counting interval, however, the
horizontal-count circuit generates a distinctive pattern of binary
numbers that actually indicate the horizontal position of the beam on
the screen. See Fig. 1-2.

The 15, 7 50-Hz output of the horizontal-counting circuit clocks
yet another 9-bit binary counter, the vertical-count circuit. This
circuit utlimately produces the necessary 60 Hz vertical-sync pulse,
but in the meantime, it also generates a 9—bit binary code that
indicates the vertical position of the beam on the screen.

In a manner of speaking, then, the TV game system always
knows exactly where the beam is situated on the CRT screen. A pair
of 9-bit binary numbers indicate the coordinates in a manner quite
similar to the x, y coordinates of a conventional graphing scheme.

Since the game system knows where the beam is located at any
given moment, it is possible to generate White or black video levels
to create images on the CRT.

Notice in Fig. 1-2 that the sync pulses, blanking pulses, and
game video information are combined to create the composite video
signal. The only step remaining after that is to place the signal onto
an rf carrier that will feed it through the tuner section of a conven-
tional receiver. The rf modulator, incidentally, can be omitted from
the system if the composite signal is applied directly to the video
ampliﬁer in the TV set. This calls for some surgery on the receiver
circuitry, and many experimenters are unable or unwilling to do that
sort of job.

As far as this book is concerned, the bulk of the circuits blocked
out in Fig. 1-2 is the same for every game. Only the game video
generator and external game controls change. Most of the circuitry
is thus built into a permanent unit called the Sourcebox unit. This
particular part of the system is described in great detail in Chapter 2.
The remainder of the book deals with experiments, examples, and
design hints for the game Video generator and external game con-
trols, units that are plugged into the standard Sourcebox.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

This book leads the prospective TV game designer through a
series of experiments, examples, and hints that are all intended to
make game design possible and fun for just about anyone willing to
make the effort. Generally speaking, the material (or “lessons,” if
you will) are presented in order of importance. It would be difﬁcult,
