connected directly to logic 1, or +5V. This connection disables the
primary-figure-initializing circuit so that the game procedes continu-
ously. There is never any condition that calls for initializing the
positions of either primary ﬁgure.

This system uses a total of eight circuit boards and two control
panels: two slipping counter and one tagalong control for each
player, as well as a vector and ﬁgure board. The tagalong system for
Player A should be operated from the +5V source for Game A, and
the tagalong system for Player B should operate from the Game-B
supply. The vector board, ﬁgure board, and two control panels must
then be powered from an auxiliary +5-V, l-A supply. Of course all
COMM connections should be connected together.
