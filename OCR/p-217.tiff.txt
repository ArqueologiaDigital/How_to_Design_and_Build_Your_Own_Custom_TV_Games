Then consider the typical table-tennis game. Whenever the ball
is served, the machine ought to be able to set the ball’s vertical
position and direction just before the serving operation takes place.

The circuits described in this chapter show how to program a
wide variety of initial positions, speeds, and directions. The exam—
ples are oriented toward manual, or player, controls, but it turns out
that the schemes for automatically setting these parameters aren’t
much different.

Programming the Initial Position

The circuit in Fig. 6-17 shows four SPDT switches, labeled A
through D, each connected to one input of an EXCLUSIVE OR gate.
The second input to each of the gates goes to a source of count
pulses from the Sourcebox, 32H, 64H, 128H, and 256H in this
particular example. The outputs of the four EXCLUSIVE OR gates
are NANDed together at a 4-input NAND gate, IC2-A. '

One of the most useful properties of an EXCLUSIVE OR gate is
that it can operate as an inverter or noninverter, depending on the
logic level presented to the second input. Consider ICl—D in Fig.
6-17. Whenever the A switch is set to its “1” position, the 32H signal
applied to the other input emerges from the gate with the same
phase as the input. Setting switch A to its “0” position, however,
causes IC1-D to invert its 32H input.

An EXCLUSIVE OR gate thus passes a noninverted version of
its signal input whenever the control input is at logic 1, but it inverts
the signal whenever the control input is at logic 0.

The circuit in Fig. 6—17 is capable of generating vertical bars on
the screen that are 32H wide and positioned at any 1 of 16 different
locations. The table accompanying the schematic shows all possible
combinations of switch settings and the output speciﬁcations that
result. If, for example, D =_O_E_hile C = B = A = 1, the effect
would be the same as applying 256H, 128H, 64H, and 32H directly to
the inputs of the NAND gate.

If you want to check out this circuit in a rather simple fashion,
run the output of the NAND gate through an inverter and to the
GAME VID IN connection on the Sourcebox. You will indeed ﬁnd
that you can create a white vertical bar that has a position on the
screen determined by the settings of switches A through D. In a
sense, this circuit is a switch-programmable line generator. Of
course you can apply any combination of H- and V-count inputs to the
four signal inputs to create horizontal and vertical lines. You can also
expand the circuit to accommodate eight signal inputs by using eight
