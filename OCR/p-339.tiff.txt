Depressing the TEE pushbutton on the control panel generates
a logic-0 level that is wired to the TEE input of this logic board. This
action initiates a 10-ms monostable multivibrator action from IC5—A.
The brief pulse from that IC increments the count of the program
counter, 1C9.

1C9 is simply a 4-bit binary counter that is wired to count nine
different binary states, 0000 (decimal 0) through 1000 (decimal 8).
Each time the player depresses his TEE pushbutton, ICE-A gener-
ates a pulse that increments that counter. The program counter’s
outputs are labeled CA through CD, where CA is the least-
signiﬁcant bit. _ _

Depressing the TEE switch also sets an R-S flip-ﬂop, com-
posed of ICZ-A and ICZ-B, to a state where the output of ICZ-A goes
to logic 0. This point is wired to the select input of a 2:1 multiplexer,
pin 1 of 1C6. As long as pin 1 of 1C6 is ﬂgic OﬂTP and VINTP
initializing pulses are directed to the HML and VML outputs of that
IC. Since these outputs eventually ﬁnd their way to the slipping-
counter board, it follows that depressing the TEE switch initializes
the slipping counter which, in turn, initializes the position of the ball
on its tee. This circuitry represents the ball initialization control
section of the system.

The ball—travel timer is built around IC5-B_ in Fig. 8-18. This is a
monostable multivibrator that is initiated by a negative-going logic
level from SWING. If the RST input at pin 10 of ICS—B is at logic 1,
depressing the SWING switch starts the timing action.

The SWING input is also connected to the reset input of the R—S
ﬂip-ﬂop, IC2-A, and ICZ-B. So when the player depresses the
SWING button on his control panel, the output of ICZ-A switches to
logic 1, altering the state of 1C6 in such _a‘ way that the slipping
counter takes its loading information from HMRST and VMRST. In '
other words, if the position of the ball has just been initialized by
depressing the TEE switch, depressing the SWING switch releases
the ball so that it can move across the screen.

Returning to the ball-travel timer, IC5-B, the time of travel is
mainly determined by the values of R11 and CS. The input at pin 11
inﬂuences the travel time as well, however. The BG input to this
logic board goes to logic 1 only when the ball is touching the green.
That logic-1 level is inverted to logic 0 by IC3-D and applied to pin 11
of IC5—B through the BGT TRIM potentiometer, R12. Lowering the
voltage at pin 11 in this fashion shortens the timing interval of the
monostable, thus giving the impression the ball slows down when it
touches the green.
