switches, four more EXCLUSIVE OR gates, and a 7430 8-input
NAND gate.

The circuits in Fig. 6-18a and 6-18b show how this circuit can be
applied to the missile-attack game. The circuit in Fig. 6-18a lets the
player adjust the horizontal position of the antiballistic missile. The
256H and 128H inputs to IClO-A ﬁx the positions to a region
spanning the middle half of the screen. The player has control over
the position of the antiballistic missile within that range by mampulat—
ing switches SA, SB, and SC. Using three switches in this manner
offers eight different launch positions.

To use this circuit in conjunction with the missile game drawn
up in Fig. 6—16, disconnect IC6-C in that circuit, and connect the
output of ICll-A in its place. Now you will be able to program the
horizontal position of the antiballistic missile, giving you a better
chance of shooting down the attack missile. If you manipulate the
switches quickly enough, you can actually steer the antiballistic
missile while it is in ﬂight.

The circuit in Fig. 6-18b can also be added to the basic missile-
attack game. This circuit, however, controls the altitude of the
attack missile. The altitude is ﬁxed within the upper third of the
screen by the 128V signal that is always inverted by IC12-A before it
is applied to NAND gate ICll-B. A player can vary the altitude of the
attack missile to any one of eight different positions within that range
by means of switches SA through SC.

Incorporating this altitude-programming circuit into the
missile-attack game is a matter of disconnecting ICZ-D in Fig. 6—16
and connecting the output of ICll-B to pin 2 of IC3-A.

Of course these are merely two speciﬁc examples of how the
position-selection scheme in Fig. 6-17 can be applied. This circuit is
quite useful in any case where you would like to have program
control over the horizontal or vertical position of an object on. the
screen.

The same circuit can also be used for deﬁning the initial position
of a movable ﬁgure. In this case, the output of the NAN D gate is used
as the source of initializing pulses. See the block diagram in Fig.
6-18c.

If you would like to check out the operation of this circuit,
construct the circuit shown back in Fig. 6-13a, then couple the
output of ICZ-A in Fig. 6-17 to the INTP input of Fig. 6-13a.

Setting INTC to logic 0, you will ﬁnd you can program the initial
position of any figure generated by the slipping counter. The ﬁgure
can then be “launched” from that initial position by setting INTC to
logic 1.
