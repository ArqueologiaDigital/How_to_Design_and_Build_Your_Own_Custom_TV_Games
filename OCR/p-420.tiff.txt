pulse generator made up of ICl-B and IC4-D. The vertical, movable
portion of the ball ﬁgure comes from another pulse generator UCLA
and IC4—C) which gets its input information from the 128V output of a
vertical-slipping counter circuit.

The ball ﬁgure is assembled at IC7—A and then inverted by
IC6—B. One portion of this inverted ball signal goes to ICZ-A where it
is essentially ORed with the top and bottom ﬁgures, and another
portion goes to the bottom and top contact sensing circuits, IC3-A
and ICS-B.

The bottom ﬁgure in this case is simply the narrow 256V line,
while the top ﬁgure is an 8V white line located about 8V from the top
of the screen. The outputs from both of these fixed-ﬁgure
generators are combined with the ball ﬁgure in ICZ-A to produce the
game’s composite ﬁgure video signal.

IC3-D and IC3-C make up an R-S ﬂip-ﬂop. This ﬂip-ﬂop is SET
(output of IC3-D goes to logic 1) whenever IC3-B senses contact
between the ball ﬁgure and the top ﬁgure. The ﬂip-ﬂop is then
RESET (output of IC3—D goes to logic 0) whenever IC3-A senses
contact between the ball ﬁgure and the bottom one.

The table accompanying the circuit in Fig. 10-2 shows how the
top and bottom contacts affect the vertical control word delivered to
the vertical—slipping counter. Whenever top contact occurs, the VC
control code is set to 0101. According to the speed and direction
control table in Fig. 7-22, this means the movable ﬁgure (the ball in
this case) is set for downward motion at the rate of 0.64 frames per
second. Whenever bottom contact occurs, the V C control code is
set to 1101, making the ball ﬁgure move upward at 0.64 ﬁames per
second.

Constructing the circuit as speciﬁed in Fig. 10—2 thus produces
a bouncing-ball effect whereby the ball bounces vertically at a rate of
about 1 H2.

A FLEXIBLE REBOUND CONTROL SYSTEM

Figure 10-3 shows a circuit that is adaptable for both horizontal
and vertical rebounding of a single ﬁgure. There can be as many as
four fixed-figure inputs: botm top, right, and left figures.
Whenever the movable ﬁgure (FIG) makes contact with any one of
the ﬁxed ﬁgures, an R-S ﬂip-ﬂop (ICl—B and ICl-D or ICZ-B and
ICZ-D) is set to a state that reverses the direction of ﬁgure motion_.lf
the ﬁgure is moving to the right and makes contact with the RT
ﬁgure, for instance, the ﬂip-ﬂop composed of IC2-B and ICZ-D
changes state and ultimately reverses the direction of horizontal
motion.
