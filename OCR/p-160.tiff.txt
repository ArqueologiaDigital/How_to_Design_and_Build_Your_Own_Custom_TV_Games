tional board games from video games. Consider, for example, some
of the programmable TV game systems on the market today. They
boast of hundreds of different video games; yet, a good many of
those same games could be played equally well on a sheet of paper.
Games relying on automatic motion give TV games the special
popularity they enjoy today.

A Simple Circuit for Vertical Motion

The simplest kind of video-motion-control circuit is one that
involves vertical motion only. The simplicity of this form of automatic
motion belies its usefulness, however. This simple circuit, combined
with some player-controlled motion and interesting complex ﬁgures
leads the experimenter to a wide variety of interesting games.
Follow the discussion and experiments carefully, and you will most
likely get a good impression of what you might be able to do on your
own.

The circuit in Fig. 5-12 allows the player to adjust the vertical
direction and speed of a simple rectangular ﬁgure. The heart of the
circuit is a free-running oscillator built around one section of a 556
timer. The values are selected so that the oscillator runs at approxi-
mately 60 Hz. There is no synchronization with the vertical—count
sequence in the Sourcebox, so it is possible to vary the oscillator
frequency above and below that 60-Hz rate.

The primary purpose of ICZ and IC3 is to window the vertically
moving rectangle so that it appears as a rectangle, rather than a
narrow horizontal bar. Build this circuit and note the video signal as it
is taken from pin 2 of inverter ICZ—A. You will ﬁnd a white horizontal
bar that moves upward or downward on the screen at a rate deter-
mined by the setting of R2.

You should be able to adjust R2 so that the bar stands still at any
desired point on the screen. There might be a slight drift in one
direction or another, but remember that this is the simplest, and not
the most precise, vertical-motion circuit.

Whenever you make the bar stand still on the screen, the
oscillator is running at the system’s vertical framing rate, about
60—Hz rate.

Adjust R2 a bit one way or another and you will ﬁnd the bar
moving upward on the screen. The farther you move the control in
that direction, the faster the motion. Whenever the bar is moving up
the screen, the oscillator is running a bit slower than the 60-Hz
vertical framing rate; and the faster the bar moves, the farther the
frequency is from 60—Hz.
