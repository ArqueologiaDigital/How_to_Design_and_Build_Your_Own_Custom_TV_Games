A cursory study of the matrix pattern in Fig. 4-11 will show that
the original 4x4 matrix is situated in the upper left-hand quadrant.
The designations for each of the cells in this quadrant correspond
exactly to the D inputs of the multiplexer in Fig. 4-5.

Then notice that the lower left-hand quadrant of this matrix is an
extended version of the upper left-hand quadrant. The left-hand half
of this 8X8 matrix, in other words, is simply the 4x8 extended
matrix described in the previous section of this chapter.

The right-hand half of this matrix is the folded portion. The
foldover cells all have an “F” sufﬁx to clearly indicate they belong to
the folded half of the matrix.

Compare the designations of the cells in the left-hand half of the
matrix with those on the right and you will ﬁnd that the right-hand
half of the diagram is really a mirror image of the other half. The
folded cell D3F, for instance, is one cell to the right of the center line,
while its originating counter-part, D3 is just left of center. D0 is in
one upper corner, while the folded version of it appears in the
opposite upper corner.

The fact that the right-hand half of this 8 X8 matrix is a mirror
image of the left-hand half means that any ﬁgure using this format
must be symmetrical around the vertical center line. While this
might seem to be a rather severe restriction at ﬁrst, it turns out that
a great many interesting and useful ﬁgures do, indeed, have a
symmetrical (mirror-image) quality. Look ahead to Fig. 4-12 for one
good example.

All that is required for achieving the foldover effect in this case
is to run the 16H and 32H signal through EXCLUSIVE-OR gates
before applying them to the SO and 81 select terminals of the
multiplexer. One input of each of the EXCLUSIVE-0R gates is
connected to 64H. So when 64H is at logic 0, noninverted versions of
16H and 32H appear at select inputs SO and 81. When 64H switches
to logic 1, however, SO and 81 see inverted versions of 16H and
32H.

The circuit thus generates the normal matrix and extended-
matrix patterns as long as 64H is at logic 0, but as soon as 64H rises
to logic 1, it effectively reverses the horizontal scanning operation.
Along the ﬁrst row of cells, for instance, 80 and 51 see binary levels
representing a normal count of 0, 1, 2, and 3. At the end of D3,
though, the EXCLUSIVE-OR gates begin reversing the count: 3, 2
1, O. A reversed image thus appears along the right-hand half of the
matrix.

Connect the basic 4x4 matrix-generating circuit shown in Fig.
4-5, then add the two EXCLUSIVE-OR gates as shown in Fig. 4-10.
