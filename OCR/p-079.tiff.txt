Building
More-Complex Static Figures

 

While it is possible to achieve a wide range of static patternsrusing
the principles outlined in the previous chapter, they generally lack
the interest that typiﬁes some of the better TV games on the market
today. The line and bar patterns are all made from straight lines and
right angles; and building something as geometrically simple as a
triangle calls for an exceedingly complex Line/ Bar Tinkerbox cir
cuit.

This chapter presents one basic approach to building static
ﬁgures of all kinds, geometric ﬁgures as well as an unlimited variety
of far-more-interesting ﬁgures such as rockets, airplanes, tanks,
people, guns, and so on. And to some extent, it is possible to use this
technique to build up some of the more complicated line, bar, and
rectangle ﬁgures described in the previous chapter.

Although this chapter presents only one basic approach, I think
you will ﬁnd it is adequate for just about any ﬁgure—building problem
you might ever encounter. The range of possible ﬁgures that can be
built is really limited only by your own understanding of how the
scheme works and, of course, your own imagination.

Follow the discussions carefully and in the sequence as pre-
sented here. You might get the impression you are studying a
textbook from time to time, but if you work out the speciﬁc examples
and then try a few of your own, you’ll have a lot of fun learning how to
build complex ﬁgures on the TV screen.

This technique, incidentally, can be extended later on to include
some animation and ﬁgure-motion effects. So the ﬁgures you create
