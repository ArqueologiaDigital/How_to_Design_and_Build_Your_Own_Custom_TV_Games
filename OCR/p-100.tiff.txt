The diagram in Fig. 4-12 is one example of an 8x8 extended
foldover ﬁgure. The idea here is to build a ﬁgure of a racing car for a
couple of different TV games. Using the select, window, and D
inputs speciﬁed in that ﬁgure generates a rather large version of the
car; so after you’ve tried building it for yourself (and maybe making a
few style modiﬁcations), reduce its size by scaling down all of the
speciﬁcations a notch or two.

Why not try designing a few more interesting and potentially
useful ﬁgures that are symmetrical about a vertical center line? Try a
rocket, for instance, or some stars, squares with black centers, and
triangles.

Figure 4—13 shows the matrix and circuitry for converting the
8XS extended foldover matrix to one having symmetry about a
horizontal center line. Three lower-order horizontal—count inputs go
to select inputs SO, 51, and 82, while S3 sees a folded version of
16V. Note that the 32V signal that is used for generating the
extended-matrix effect must also be folded before it is applied to the
appropriate D inputs of the multiplexer circuit.

An example of an 8x8 extended, horizontally folded image is
shown in Fig. 4-14. As with every matrix-generated ﬁgure in this
chapter, it can be reduced in size by scaling down all the vertical- and
horizontal-count inputs. Using the speciﬁcations given in Fig. 4-14,
the airplane occupies most of the lower right-hand quadrant of the
screen.

Figure 4-15 shows yet another version of the 64—cell extended
foldover matrix built around the circuit in Fig. 4-5. In this instance
the matrix is conﬁgured as a 4 X 16, with symmetry about the vertical
axis. Using the select, window, and data speciﬁcations shown here,
this particular matrix is quite useful for building missile images. See
the suggested missile in Fig. 4-16.

See if you can apply your understanding of how the foldover
principle works to generate a missile image that ﬁts into a 16x4
matrix that is folded along the horizontal center line.

MATRIX OPERATIONS FROM A 32-CELL GENERATOR

The circuit in Fig. 4-5 is a basic 16—cell matrix generator. By
applying extended-matrix and matrix foldover procedures, it is pos-
sible to build 32-cell and 64-cell matrices. The only restriction on the
kinds of ﬁgures it can generate is that the 64—cell version is good only _
for making symmetrical ﬁgures.

And while it is a lot of fun to play with the system just described,
personal experience with it shows that other people sometimes have
