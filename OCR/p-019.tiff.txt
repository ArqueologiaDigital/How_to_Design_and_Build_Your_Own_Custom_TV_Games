Chapter 2
The Sourcebox Unit

 

The Sourcebox unit described in this chapter contains all the cir-
cuitry common to virtually all the TV games described in this book. It
is the interface unit that stands between the game itself and the TV
receiver. The Sourcebox unit, for instance, generates all the sync
and blanking signals that synchronize both the TV raster and the
game operations. Unless this system is built and made to operate
properly, the experimenter cannot hope to make any real progress
in his or her understanding of anything else that follows.

This chapter describes the theory of operation, shows com-
plete circuit detail, and provides some practical hints on construc-
tion. The opening section of Chapter 2 gives the experimenter an
opportunity to test the system.

The block diagram in Fig. 2-1 shows the basic circuits contained
in the Sourcebox unit. The purpose of each block might be self-
evident to anyone who has made a thorough study of the material in
Chapter 1. The following sections of this chapter, however, describe
the purpose and theory of each block in some detail. The construc-
tion hints are inserted at appropriate places in the discuSsion, rather
than at the end of the chapter.

SOURCEBDX ORGANIZATION V

The Sourcebox unit is organized into 10 basic circuits as de-
scribed here:

1. Power supply â€”The power supply provides DC voltage
levels to all of the circuits in the Sourcebox unit as well as
